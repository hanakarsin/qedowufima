So it didn’t surprise many of their fans when they decided to open a gym together in March 2013, just a few months before their wedding on June 15, 2013.</p><p>Located in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif., Tamra and Eddie’s gym, CUT Fitness (short for Cardio Unique Training), was an intentional “micro gym” with no more than “50 people” working out in the facility at a time. Due to Tamra and Eddie’s RHOC fame, the gym ran smoothly until the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Just two months after Tamra announced her departure from RHOC in January 2020, she admitted that the COVID-19 lockdowns, which began that March, impacted CUT’s clientele. While the lockdowns eventually ended, Tamra still struggled to keep the gym open, even after selling a piece of the space to a chiropractor to make ends meet.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In August 2022, Tamra and Eddie shut CUT’s doors down for good amid ongoing financial woes. Tamra briefly discussed closing her gym on her and <a href=#>Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave</a>’s podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Two T’s and a Pod</a>, and said the pandemic mainly caused the decision. According to the RHOC star, the business was “doing good” prior to COVID-19.</p><p>“Listen, we almost made it to [10] years,” Tamra said on her podcast. “I’m proud of what we did, what we built.”</p><p>“It is what it is,” she continued. “It’s sad. It’s a loss. It’s 100 percent a loss. It’s hard.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tamra denies that her ‘RHOC’ return had anything to do with her gym closing down.</h2><p>Before they closed CUT Fitness, Tamra and Eddie publicly sold most of the gym’s equipment on its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official Instagram page</a>. Once eagle-eyed fans noticed that the couple was selling their items along with the fitness center and some threw shade Tamra’s way.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>During the same Two T’s and a Pod episode where Tamra confirmed CUT was closing, Teddi addressed a comment Tamra received from a fellow small business owner. The owner wrote on Instagram that Tamra’s return to RHOC was way too convenient and stated she only came back to the show because “she has no money.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Tamra refuted the user’s claim and said Bravo hired her back after she closed CUT.</p><p>“We decided to close our gym down way before I got asked back to the show,” Tamra declared, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>. “So that had nothing to do with anything that's going on right now.”</p><p>In Tamra’s first scene of RHOC Season 17, the Vena Wellness CEO said her reasons for coming back to the show were more personal than financial. After her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">meltdown in the bushes</a> during a fight with <a href=#>Gina Kirschenheiter</a> in Season 14, Tamra said she wanted to redeem herself and show her calmer side.</p><p>Tamra did admit, though, that CUT’s closing has been incredibly difficult for Eddie since the gym was his “baby” and he loves helping others get fit.</p><p>While CUT Fitness is no more, many RHOC fans are delighted to see Tamra back on the show and will likely support whatever she does next.</p><p>Watch new episodes of The Real Housewives of Orange County Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2askaK%2FonnCpaasnV2YwrV5xaKrp52jqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vivo-trailer-release-date.html><span>←</span><span>The 'Vivo' Official Trailer Is Here Plot, Release Date, and More!</span></a>
