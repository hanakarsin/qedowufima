For many, business will have changed as we know it. We will need to pivot and find creative ways to succeed. . I've spent a lot of this very challenging time doing relief work-finding a way to help those warriors risking their lives for ours, who need essential protective gear, to do their jobs properly and safely-to protect themselves. I believe I've been effective and had an impact because I've treated it like a business, setting goals, and executing them one by one. . THE BIG SHOT WITH BETHENNY (working title) is a show with an authentic genuine look into what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur through a non traditional approach. With branding, marketing, sales, and creative projects, applicants will be working in a real life business community learning what it takes to make it in our cutthroat world. I will let people into the inner workings of my life, my business, and my philanthropy to show how to be successful and execute a vision, even when the odds are against me. The participants and the audience will see how decisions get made and failures and successes happen every day. . I am looking to and for the future...I want to pay it forward and give someone the opportunity to carve their own path to success by truly taking them under my wing. I also want the audience to see how they can come from 'A Place of Yes' and make their business dreams come true once we enter the “new normal” in the coming months. .
