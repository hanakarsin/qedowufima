The first stamps were issued in 1847, and city delivery got its start in 1863.</p><p>It’s a common assumption that the USPS is a federal agency, and its 7.3 million workers are federal employees. But actually, the post office isn't funded by tax dollars.</p><p>Clearing this misconception up is the number one item on their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Top Thirteen Things You Should Know about the U.S. Postal Service</u></a> page.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">If not for taxes, how is the post office funded?</h2><p>Mail delivery is a service you receive, but not one you pay for — outside of the postage that you purchase.</p><p>That’s because the post office is a quasi-federal agency, and as such, is not funded by the U.S. government. Postal workers receive federal benefits, but are not actually considered federal employees.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Its official statement is, “The Postal Service receives NO tax dollars for operating expenses and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations.”</p><p>So it’s your books of stamps, flat-rate boxes, packing and shipping materials, and even the adorable greeting cards they offer at checkout that keeps their operations running.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But the USPS may run out of money this year.</h2><p>Even before the novel <a href=#><u>coronavirus</u></a> struck, impacting people and businesses across the country and around the world, the USPS was in serious financial trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) calls the post office’s financial viability a high-risk issue, saying, “Comprehensive legislative reform and additional cost-cutting measures are needed for the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to achieve sustainable financial viability.”</p><p>“USPS has lost $69 billion over the past 11 fiscal years — including $3.9 billion in fiscal year 2018. USPS’s total unfunded liabilities and debt ($143 billion at the end of fiscal year 2018) have grown to double its annual revenue.”</p><p>As CNN reports, the USPS told Congress it would be out of money by September back in April of 2020.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here’s why it’s in financial trouble.</h2><p>GAO cites a deteriorating financial situation, insufficient cost savings, and unfavorable trends as the reasons behind the post office’s poor financial performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Its expenses are also growing faster than its revenue because of increased wages, a decrease in mail volume, and something known as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pre-funded healthcare</u></a> — a hot topic within the postal community.</p><p>For many years, the USPS was the only federal agency subject to a pre-funding mandate on future retiree health benefits.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Under the mandate, they were on the hook to pay between $5.5 and $5.8 billion a year, and postal losses mounted.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite partial deferrals from Congress and the proposed USPS Fairness Act to eliminate pre-funded health benefits, the agency has accrued a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reported</u></a> whopping $120 billion in pension and other post-employment unfunded liabilities.</p><p>The Fairness Act <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>passed</u></a> in the House of Representatives in February 2020, and a Senate vote is pending.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The future of the USPS is in jeopardy.</h2><p>In March, the $2 trillion Coronavirus Relief Bill reserved <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>$25 billion</u></a> for the USPS under the CARES Act, which was blocked by the Trump administration.</p><p>The administration then offered a $10 billion loan under <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>terms</u></a> in which control over the mail service would shift to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and package rates would be quadrupled in exchange for the funding.</p><p>Postal experts clapped back, saying these increases “would quickly bankrupt the agency by pricing out the likes of UPS, FedEx and Amazon from contracting with the Postal Service.”</p><p>In April, the post office requested $75 billion in emergency funding to continue processing and delivering some 48 percent of the world’s mail. As of now, the funding is still hanging in the balance.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">And the stakes are higher than ever with the upcoming election.</h2><p>With a probable mail-in ballot voting system set for this election year, the pressure is on to settle financial unrest and questions of whether the postal service will be equipped to handle the process.</p><p>Postmaster Louis DeJoy has been invited to testify in front of the House Oversight Committee “in a sign of congressional concern over the possibility of delays.”</p><p>The testimony was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reportedly requested</u></a> "to examine recent changes to U.S. Postal Service operations and standards and the need for on-time mail delivery during the ongoing pandemic and upcoming election, which as you know may be held largely by mail-in ballot."</p><p>Stay tuned for more on the future of the USPS during this unprecedented time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpby0wIyonZ%2Bhk5p6p8HNnaCnnw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tara-wilson-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tara Wilson - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
