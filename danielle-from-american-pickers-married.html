Before the show aired, she married Robert Strong in 2004. The pair shared two children, but Danielle said that, eventually, the fame wore on the family. In an interview with WQAD, she said that "fame and notoriety are not easy for him to deal with at all, so the relationship ended up not working out."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: INSTAGRAM/@daniellecolbyamericanpicker</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Danielle from 'American Pickers' married?</h2><p>Once the relationship fell apart, Danielle was obviously left with a lot of decisions, including how to navigate a divorce and custody agreements. Another big choice she had to make was whether or not to pursue love again and, this time, find someone who was able to handle her newfound fame. Thankfully, there was someone that Danielle felt a connection worth pursuing again. Danielle married Jeremy Scheuch in February 2024, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Danielle's second husband, Jeremy Scheuch?</h2><p>While Robert apparently couldn't handle the high-profile life, Jeremy seems to be totally leaning into it. Ditching an identity of his own, he describes himself on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram </a>as "Danielle’s Hunky Husband." As for what he actually does, though, he has his own career in the art world with a strong focus on photography. He shows off his striking snaps of nature and animals on his Instagram and professional <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">portfolio</a>. "Semi-retired artist living in Puerto Rico via Chicago and Kansas City," he writes.</p><p>According to the website, Jeremy received a Bachelors in Fine Arts and Printmaking from the Kansas City Art Institute, also bragging that he studied abroad in Australia as part of his studies. He additionally notes special exhibits that his work has been featured in over the years, including 2004 Born Again! Modern Madonnas and Contemporary Christs and 2010 The Last Unicorn Art Show, Tattoo Factory Gallery.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Danielle Colby “Queen Of Rust” (@daniellecolbyamericanpicker)</a></p></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DO512</a>, Jeremy had a moment of his own fame before he met Danielle. He went viral online in 2014 for being a massive Kansas City Chiefs fan. While attending a football game, he made it onto the television a few times for his reactions in the stands. A screenshot of the moment went viral, ushering in a spotlight on him for a 15-minutes-of-fame moment.</p><p>"My phone won't stop blowing up. I've already gone through one battery today. It's been ridiculous. I've got a radio interview tomorrow morning out of Kansas City and I'm getting ready to jump on Skype to do a TV interview with Channel 5 in Kansas City. Shameless self-promotion. 'Oh yes, I do have an art website, you should go buy art!'" he told the publication at the time.</p><p>While Jeremy is cool with Danielle's fame, he's seemingly not interested in pursuing his own anymore. "No, after this I'm done. Unless the Royals want to fly me out and have me be their mustache coach or facial hair coach. I love them, but they've got some awful facial hair. They have these weird Amish beards going on," he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma6vtcSlo55llqe8rnnAppyroZOWu268yJyinqqjYrqivtGinJ0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./candis-cayne-html.html><span>←</span><span>Candis Cayne - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
