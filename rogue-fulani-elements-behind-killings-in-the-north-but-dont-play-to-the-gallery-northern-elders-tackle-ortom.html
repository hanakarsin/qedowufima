Even while making allowances for the established patterns of rhetorics and practice of Governor Ortom on inter-communal relations, this latest outburst should be condemned in a most emphatic manner.</p><p>“It does neither justice to the condemnable killings in Benue State nor to the standing of the Governor of his people. The context of a politicised environment does not excuse this latest demeaning outing of Governor Ortom. On the contrary, it diverts attention from the latest tragedy that has befallen citizens and families in Benue State.”</p><p>The group said the forum would continue to demand that those who are asking for votes in 2023 from the north would show in clear and specific terms how they plan to secure Nigerians.</p><p>Baba-Ahmed said: “They must also demonstrate how they intend to address damaging profiling and deliberate exploitation of passions eminently demonstrated by Governor Ortom.</p><p>“The Forum demands that leaders and politicians de-politicise the scourge of insecurity under which we all live. Governor Ortom should live up to his oath and his commitment to his mandate to live as a responsible leader of his people.</p><p>“He should avoid the temptation to play to a gallery which, like all Nigerians, is desperate for relief and an end to the killings which pitch them against each other and leads them towards unending conflicts.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BpZqunl6qybrLUpZinoV2auaa5xKerrGWSmrWqusNmoqKknJ67qL%2BMoqVmrJiaeq%2B70a2fZpqlqXqlu82tZKmkka56tbuMrZ%2BeZZeWua2x0bJkp6eiqbWmvs1mnKWclafAbsDAnKKlnV2kv7W7zGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ntufam-hillard-etta.html><span>←</span><span>Read All The Latest News About Ntufam Hillard Etta On Naija News</span></a>
