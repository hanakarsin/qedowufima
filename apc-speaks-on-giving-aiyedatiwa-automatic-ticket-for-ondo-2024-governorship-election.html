We will explain to the people if and when we do that,” he said.</p><h2>Possibilities Of Aiyedatiwa Returning As Governor</h2><p>Recall that Aiyedatiwa was a Deputy Governor to the late Ondo State Governor, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Rotimi Akeredolu.</strong></a></p><p>However, after his principal’s painful demise due to prolonged illness, Aiyedatiwa was sworn in as the substantive governor of the South-West state on December 27, 2023.</p><p>Given the inconsolable and somber atmosphere in the state following Akeredolu’s passing, it may seem premature for Aiyedatiwa to express interest in the 2024 gubernatorial election. However, ambition is a progressive trait.</p><p>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has already scheduled the Ondo State Governorship Poll for November 16, 2024, unless there are unforeseen changes.</p><p>Aiyedatiwa, who will complete Akeredolu’s second term by February 2025, is constitutionally eligible to run for office and have his name on the ballot. If the electorate chooses, he could remain the governor of the state for an additional eight years.</p><p>Nevertheless, keen observers analyzing the political climate in Ondo are pondering whether Aiyedatiwa will indeed run for office or gracefully step aside by February 2025. Can he win the support of the influential figures in Akeredolu’s camp and secure a potential electoral victory? Only time will reveal the answers to these questions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5BxZpqok2LAsbHApKpmp55itKrCyKeeZpmZrrKlrdOirpplkarBsLnAraCcZaSesKyx02adqKpdpLulu4xrZ2tsXZy8t7HRp6arq5ievW6xy56araGfo3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./diamond-platnumz-html.html><span>←</span><span>Diamond Platnumz - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
