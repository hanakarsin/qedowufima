Sometimes all it takes is for one viral video to spread like wildfire. For others, its persistent uploads slowly build up their follower base.</p><p>The thing about the platform is that even though it's difficult to predict who or what's going to be popular, there are some niches one can try to become a part of and some rough rubrics to follow.</p><p>For instance, there seem to be a lot of different folks who create TikToks about their jobs. Like this one guy who works for Cold Stone who managed to garner over 11 million followers by recording how he makes his ice cream creations while working for the dessert franchise. Not bad for someone who's working and getting paid while...getting paid, right?</p><p>So it would make sense that others would try similar recipes for success, or that users on the platform would be interested in seeing other food service employees go about their day.</p><p>Like Angelo Bahu who apparently works at a cool-looking Donut spot called Yonutz Fantastical Donuts and Ice Cream. Angelo recently uploaded a TikTok of an irate customer who was acting incredibly mean.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@yoangelolo href=#>@yoangelolo</a><p>why do people</p><a title="♬ original sound - Angelo Bahu" href=#>♬ original sound - Angelo Bahu</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @yoangelolo</span></figure><p>A little...too mean some TikTokers theorized. Angelo says that they were recording themselves while at work to make some TikToks for the platform when a customer expressed the young man was taking too long to complete an order.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@yoangelolo href=#>@yoangelolo</a><p>did not expect the first part to blowup so here is the rest</p><a title="♬ Tell Me Why I'm Waiting - Timmies/Shiloh" href=#>♬ Tell Me Why I'm Waiting - Timmies/Shiloh</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @yoangelolo</span></figure><p>"I gotta be home, let's go." The customer says off-camera. Bahu then informs the donut buyer that he's going as quickly as he can, to which the customer responds with, "You want a tip or? You gotta hurry up, gotta get your tip."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @yoangelolo</span></figure><p>To make matters worse, the customer outright refuses to give Angelo the money for the donut order after receiving the desserts, which does seem a bit strange. "No we're good," the individual off-camera tells TikToker.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @yoangelolo</span></figure><p>Angelo posted a follow-up video afterward where the customer tells him, "You can call your boss my wallet's not coming out of my pocket. Simple as that."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @yoangelolo</span></figure><p>In-text superimposed over the video, Angelo wrote, "He wouldn't pay cus I took too long." The interaction escalates when the customer tells Angelo that he could basically pay for the donuts from his tip jar, dumping the money all over the counter.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @yoangelolo</span></figure><p>Angelo said that he actually likes working at Yonutz and the customer in question was an irregularity: usually the folks he gets to visit the store are much nicer.</p><p>There were tons of TikTokers who felt bad for Angelo and couldn't believe how rude the customer was, however, there were some who thought that the entire incident was staged.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @yoangelolo</span></figure><p>If it was staged, it would make sense: there are plenty of viral clips on the platform that focuses on the outrage people feel towards rude customers or folks who treat service workers with disrespect.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @yoangelolo</span></figure><p>Couple that with Angelo being a young, enthusiastic kid having fun at work and having to deal with an irate and mean customer, and it has all the makings of a viral video.</p><p>Both of his clips about the incident received millions of views a piece.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @yoangelolo</span></figure><p>Angelo went on to say that the customer ultimately paid for the donuts. What do you think? Are the clips legit? Or is Angelo just trying to become TikTok famous?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbyvwdNmqqGnoGLEsL7KnqlmrJ%2BkerS4zrA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./292325-zaidi-ya-vijana-30-wapatikana-na-magonjwa-ya-zinaa-katika-zoezi-la-kuwasajili-makurutu-wa-kdf-html.html><span>←</span><span>Zaidi ya vijana 30 wapatikana na magonjwa ya zinaa katika zoezi la kuwasajili makurutu wa KDF</span></a>
