The term &#34;skibidi&#34; is derived from the skibidi toilet trend.Some assume the term is used as a synonym for &#34;bad&#34; or &#34;evil.&#34;Unfortunately, there is not an exact or agreed-upon definition, which makes its use confusing to many.There are few trends on the internet that don't need at least a little bit of context to make sense, but as the younger generation continues to become more internet-savvy and build their own communities online, there's a lot of slang that's baffling to even the most chronically-online Gen Z or Millennial."><meta name=author content="Lourie Helzer"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The series of videos depicts various toilets with heads growing out of the bowls, dancing, singing, and committing various heinous acts.</p><p>But what exactly does "skibidi" mean?

The word is hard to define.</h2><p>Though "skibidi" is a term used often online, specifically with younger internet users, it does not necessarily have an exact meaning. The word was originally used as a song title for a single by the Russian rave band <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Big</a> in 2018, though it seems to be unrelated to the current and crazy head-sprouting toilets.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Urban Dictionary</a> has a handful of user-submitted definitions, each just as uncertain as the last, though most of the definitions suggest it is only used in conversations filled with "brain rot."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Someone said “skibidi Krabs” and ive never frowned harder <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Hit0Nd1VBK</a></p>— Perfectly Paused SpongeBob Frames (@PausedSponge) <a href=#>November 16, 2023</a></figure><p>"It is the worst meme possibly conceived if you can even consider it a meme," one answer reads. "It is so unbelievably wretched and cretinous to where anyone over the age of [five] knows that it is terrible... The meme is so terrible and absolutely f--king atrocious that it makes me, and several other groups of people, want to rip their eyes out."</p><p>"A word used by gamers who are on YouTube Shorts every day and are on a 3000-day streak of being virgin," another definition implies.

According to the outlet, the term is "used in gaming to describe someone who is evil or bad."</p><p>This seems to be because the skibidi toilets (the dancing ones with heads coming out of the bowls in videos online) are known to be evil, trying to take over the world. How does a toilet commit acts of violence? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p>That said, this definition does not make complete sense in all contexts, so it's possible this isn't really what it means, or that the word has multiple definitions. If you want to know with confidence what "skibidi" really means, you may have to ask a member of Gen Alpha to understand fully.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXai4qq7InaBmpZWWuw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-president-tinubu-sacks-irukera-okoh-as-ceos-of-fccpc-bpe.html><span>←</span><span>President Tinubu Sacks Irukera, Okoh As CEOs Of FCCPC, BPE</span></a>
