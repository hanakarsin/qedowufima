For example, Nigeria, it says allows a general description of collateral, which makes it easy for local entrepreneurs to get credit.</p><p>“The biggest impact was in the area of getting credit, where Nigeria improved its credit information system through a central bank guideline defining the licensing, operational and regulatory requirements for a privately owned credit bureau.
