Keep reading to find out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Getty Images</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Robert Fischer now?</h2><p>It seems that Robert Fischer is currently free, as the charges against him were overturned back in 2021, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a>. It was unclear at the time if prosecutors would be pursuing other charges against him, and no information has come out in the time since regarding his being investigated by other government entities.</p><p>Fischer reportedly resides in Orange County, Calif., and appears to operate a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">divorce law office</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Robert Fischer? He was previously convicted of murdering Norman "Lee" Radder.</h2><p>The legal situation surrounding Fischer and his alleged involvement in the death of Norman "Lee" Radder has been a topic of interest for investigators for more than a decade now. For context, Fischer was convicted of murder in 2013 for Radder's 2010 death. Radder, who was married to Fischer's stepdaughter, lived with her and their three children in Queen Creek, Ariz., and Fischer was staying with the family at the time of Radder's death.</p><p>According to the Associated Press, Radder was shot dead in the right eye with Fischer's gun after a night of drinking. After it occurred, Fischer called 911 to report that Radder had committed suicide, and investigators went with that for a while. However, things changed after some time and police began suspecting that Fischer, who has previous law enforcement experience, killed Radder and staged the murder as a suicide.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: NBC</a></figure><p>Two months after Fischer's initial murder conviction in 2013, a judge moved for a retrial, citing that the decision was "contrary to the weight of the evidence." Shortly after that, the Arizona Court of Appeals decided to shoot down that move and claim that the trial judge abused her discretion by overturning his conviction. This then prompted the Arizona Supreme Court to shoot down the Arizona Court of Appeals and side with the trial judge, ordering an official retrial.</p><p>In 2018, also per the Associated Press, Fischer was once again convicted of Radder's murder. He returned to prison until 2021 when prosecutors cited an "interest of justice" and overturned Fischer's conviction, a move that was granted by the judge. No other specific details were given by the prosecution about what prompted this surprising request, but it once again set Fischer free.</p><p>Now, Dateline is looking to peel back the layers of Fischer's alleged involvement in Radder's death yet again with a special episode dedicated to the situation and all of its many legal details.
