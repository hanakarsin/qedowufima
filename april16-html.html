<span>Chauncey Koziol</span></p><h1>April 16 Horoscope and Zodiac</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The Aries is under the planetary rulership of Mars, but as you were born in the third Decan, or part, of the sign, you are given the planetary power of Jupiter as well. Mars, being planet of assertiveness, is connected to your aggressive and vigorous qualities, but it is Jupiter, the planet of expansion, that links to your optimism, generosity and truth seeking nature. More so than any of the Aries Decans, your planetary influence makes you destined for higher learning. You may find yourself on a life long journey to acquire knowledge, which may lead you to explore philosophical and spiritual questions. These qualities make you a bit of a dreamer, but luckily your drive for success helps keep your mind grounded in the here and now. In love, find a partner that shares in your thirst for knowledge and adventurous spirit, as this pairing will bring you the most happiness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p63MqKysmpmnwamwwLKqZ5ufonypu9GoqpynoJp8orzRoqNqbl6dwa64</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1324485-amy-smart-bio-age-height-net-worth-husband-movies-tv-shows-html.html><span>←</span><span>Amy Smart bio: Age, height, net worth, husband, movies and TV shows</span></a>
