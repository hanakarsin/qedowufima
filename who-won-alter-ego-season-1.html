Following their performances, the judges convened to crown a winner.</p><p>After 10 weeks of competition, singing, and pouring their hearts out, the winner of the competition is ... Dipper Scott! While all the contestants made great strides in tackling their social anxiety and finding their voices, Jake Thomsen is the next digital superstar.</p><p>The season finale was close, but Jake stole the show with his performance of “All I Want” by Kodaline. Ahead of his performance, he shared the truth about his chronic illness with judges, who were visibly moved by his story. In the end, Jake not only won a $100,000 prize but will.i.am also extended an offer to pay Jake's medical bills.</p><p>Jake spoke about his momentous win in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gold Derby</a>.</p><p>He shared, “I just remember it being whittled down from four, to three, to two and thinking, ‘There’s no way that I’m actually gonna win this.' So when [Rocsi] announced it I feel like I fell to the ground. I actually don’t remember what happened. I just remember being like, ‘This is insane!'”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">These four final contestants went head-to-head in the finale.</h2><p>The final four contestants at the Season 1 finale were as follows: Samaera Hirsch aka <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Misty Rose</a>, Kyara Tetreault aka <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seven</a>, Jacob (Jake) Thomsen (Calinoda) aka <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dipper Scott</a>, and Israa Darwich aka <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Night Journey</a>.</p><p>Samaera began the show in the bottom two or three but quickly regained traction and won her head-to-head round in Week 7. Misty Rose was a popular avatar, and fans knew when she came on stage, she would bring a powerful voice with her. Samaera described her singing style as "pop princess," and she showed off her ability to entertain throughout the season with roller skates and pyrotechnics!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Misty Rose on FOX (@mistyrosefox)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Canada native Kyara Tetreault has quite a fan following on Twitter, and they were quick to let anyone know she was their clear choice of winner. One user wrote, "I will buy #Seven's album no matter what." Seven advertised herself as a rock and soul singer, and she brought the vocals! During Week 9, she was deemed "Safe" after her performance of Michael Bublé's "Feeling Good."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Seven on Fox (@seven.onfox)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Kyara isn't the only one with an internet fan following. Quite a few people rooted for Jake's digital avatar Dipper Scott as well. Jake was almost eliminated on the first episode of the show but steadily proved himself with his soulful melodies.

After being at risk during Week 3, she battled it out during Week 8 and won the head-to-head competition to snag her spot in the finale.
