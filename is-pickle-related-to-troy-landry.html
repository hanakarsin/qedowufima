(Or at least, she was when Season 12 was filmed ‚Äî her Facebook profile currently says "single.") Some viewers assume Pickle and Troy are related because they do act like kin on the show. Their banter seems indicative of a closer relationship, but in the end, it seems like Pickle is simply close with Troy because she's close with Chase.&nbsp;</p><p>One fan tweeted, "I‚Äôm loving the Troy-Pickles duo.

"The banter between Troy Landry and Cheyenne Pickle Wheat on @SwampPeople is hilarious," another fan wrote.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>It's clear that Pickle appreciates Troy, as she dedicated a post to him on Facebook recently. "This has got to be my favorite picture of us!! Can‚Äôt even begin to explain the hilarious relationship we have on and off camera. I cannot appreciate this man enough for everything he has taught me and for treating me like one of his own!

In fact, there are more photos of her and Troy than there are of her and Chase, so maybe that's why so many people think Pickle and Troy are related.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>And then there's this: "This is the face you make when you have the best captain in the swamp!!
