Kenyans must not allow the Salaries and Remuneration Commission to be selective and discriminatory in its determination. A housing benefit is extended to all Public Servants and State Officers alike," he said on Saturday, June 8, amid growing public anger over the lawmakers' persistent push for the pay rise.<p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: SRC files case to force MPs to refund millions in house allowances awarded by Parliamentary Service Commission</strong></p><p class=align-left>The MPs have allegedly hatched an elaborate plan to paralyse operations of the SRC and slash allowances of the commissioners and other public servants including President Uhuru Kenyatta after the salaries body refused to approve their house allowance.</p><p class=align-left>The commission had on Tuesday, May 7, issued a statement indicating it was the only body mandated with determining salaries and allowances of state officials.</p><p class=align-left>Its chairperson Lyn Mengich described the MPs move to award themselves more allowances a violation of the constitution, stating that action would be taken regarding the same.</p>"Article 260 of the Constitution categorises members of Parliament as State Officers and as such, determination of their remuneration and benefits is the exclusive responsibility of the SRC. Payment of any remuneration and benefits, which have not been set or advised by SRC is in violation of the Constitution,” the statement read.<p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Uhuru Kenyatta scolds MPs after they demanded rent-free houses, cars</strong></p><p class=align-left>The 349 Kenyan legislators earn a basic salary of about KSh 740,000 each minus the allowances.</p><p class=align-left>Add the allowances and the monthly take home shoots up to above KSh 1 million.</p><p class=align-left>The SRC raised the red flag when it emerged legislators had awarded themselves some KSh 2.25 million in April 2019 in the name of housing allowance which was backdated to August 2018.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a life-changing story you would like us to publish?
