The people of Nigeria also have the right to determine who governors them.</p><p>“Where the President comes from has never been the problem of Nigeria. I can cite examples — neither will it be the solution.</p><p>“There is no such thing as a president from southern Nigeria or a President from northern Nigeria. There is only one — a President from Nigeria, for Nigeria and by Nigerians.</p><p>“Talking about inclusion, I will like to see a new national working committee of our party that has sizeable numbers of youths and women.</p><p>“The decision of NEC today will either see us PDP in the villa in 2023 or not. Since the inception, this party has faced serious challenges and has risen above sentiment to solve those challenges and move forward.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49wZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm6t06KirmWfpbKvv4yup2annmLHsLrIp55mqJ%2BssrN50airmqyZpLtw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./abiodun-olujimi.html><span>←</span><span>Read All The Latest News About Abiodun Olujimi On Naija News</span></a>
