Likewise, folklore that <a href=#>McDonald's uses human meat</a> has been prevalent for several years now.</p><p>We're doing a deep dive into how the <a href=#>urban legends</a> surrounding McDonald's came to be, and we'll be looking into what their hamburger meat is actually made of — stay tuned.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: McDonald's</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where does the McDonald's uses human meat urban legend come from?</h2><p>Apparently, the rumor that McDonald's uses human meat was spread by a site called, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Huzlers</a>, which posts satire stories, including a piece about an Oklahoma City McDonald's restaurant that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blended both human and horse meat</a> into their burger patties, according to Eat This, Not That!. Obviously, the news story was totally fake, and eventually, readers realized they had been fooled.</p><p>With that, a number of people have come to believe that McDonald's patties aren't made of real beef, and to cover that up, the chain supposedly buys its beef supplies from a company called 100 Percent Beef. This part of the rumor, however, was proven incorrect, as McDonald's is relatively transparent about sourcing its ingredients.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does McDonald's actually use in their patties though?</h2><p>Like we said previously, as a whole, the Golden Arches are pretty open about what they use in terms of ingredients, as well as who they use as suppliers — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on an FAQ page on their website</a>, one user, Muhannad asked, "are you using humans meat in the food," and the chain responded with, well, the response most of us probably expected to hear.</p><p>In response to the inquiry, McDonald's said: "Hi Muhannad! We use 100% pure and Halal beef and chicken in our food sourced from approved suppliers who abide by our strict quality, safety and Halal standards.&nbsp;To help you have a clearer picture of what goes into our patties, kindly click on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a> which explains the process from farm to tray. Thanks for stopping by!" So that explains it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Someone supposedly "found" a finger in their Wendy's chili once, but they plated it there.</h2><p>Although there hasn't been human meat found in McDonald's burgers as of publication, a 39-year-old woman named Anna Ayala once <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"found" a finger in her Wendy's chili,</a> back in March 2005. Supposedly, according to New York Times, she was eating at a San Jose, Calif. location, when she "unexpectedly" discovered human remains in her food. &nbsp;</p><p>However, the finger in the chili turned out to be a hoax — apparently, the missing appendage belonged to a colleague of Anna's husband... which is pretty disgusting, if you ask us.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: GIPHY</a></figure><p>We're truly relieved that McDonald's isn't using human meat in their burger patties, or else the Big Macs we're picking up this weekend would look pretty nasty. Needless to say, don't believe everything you read on the internet. Some of it could actually be "fake news."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforClu82ao52rXZ3Crq3NZqSemaQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-skibidi-mean.html><span>←</span><span>The Origins of &amp;quot;Skibidi&amp;quot; Are Baffling But What Does It Mean?</span></a>
