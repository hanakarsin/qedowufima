I thought when accusations are made, the right thing is a proper investigation. Why are they in haste to suspend a man because he voiced out the truth, this is very tyrannical indeed.”</p><p>@Ike_Chike wrote: “I don’t think Nigerians understand what a TRILLION is.

Abdul Ningi deserves what he got. He wants to swim in a river infested with crocks. LP senators should expect their own medicine. Reason, because, all opposition senators, despite having more numbers, voted for Akpabio and took backseat. Ningi’s case is akin 2 Chioma Okoli’s.”</p><p>@SafeeyanM wrote: “We, the PDP members, should gather and know what to do with Senator Mai Doki; he is a PDP member, and he was the one that moved the motion for Abdul Ningi’s suspension; the likes of Senator Mai Doki should not be given a chance to contest anything under our party. He is a disgrace.“</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5BrZq2glaiybq%2FRoqSippGhtrXFjJyYp6afqXqpu8udZKudkZjBqrvNrGSaq12osq%2Bt055krK2jpbKvsNJmmJucpaF6r7XNoKBmnp%2BnerW00Z6cZqWfo8Gpv4yorZ6qXWd9c4CMm6ydn5WperGtw52gp59dmLmitcxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cosmic-love-filming-location.html><span>←</span><span>What's Your Sign?
