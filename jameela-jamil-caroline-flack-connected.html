The note also contained death and rape threats. Alongside the screenshot, Jameela wrote that she gets these types of messages frequently because of a post from Piers.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>No mosquitoes shall be biting my arse in this. @graziauk 📸 @joshinfilm 👗 @luxurylaw 💄 and 💇🏻‍♀️ by me.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Jameela Jamil</a> (@jameelajamilofficial) on Jun 30, 2020 at 9:27am PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>“I get messages like this every day because @piersmorgan implied that I was responsible for Caroline’s death just because she and I had a mild disagreement about her TV shows, where I wasn’t actually criticising her, 8 months before she passed. The media killed her, not me," Jameela wrote alongside the post, which has since been deleted. She continued, claiming that Piers had used a message from Caroline to harass her.&nbsp;</p><p>"She reached out to me a few days before she died because she was sad to see how much hate I was getting from the media, (which massively was coming from Morgan at the time) and then she passed a few days later," Jameela continued. "He then used a dead woman’s message out of context to harass me."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What did Piers Morgan post about Jameela Jamil and Caroline Flack that caused the uproar?</h2><p>Piers' <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">initial post</a> came in February, shortly after Caroline's death. At the time, he posted a screenshot that allegedly had a message from Caroline in which she wrote "Please have pictures ... I’m struggling with Jameela ... the hate she aims at me.” The message is believed to be related to criticisms that Jameela leveled at a show Caroline was set to host called The Surgery, which asked people who wanted to have plastic surgery to pitch the reasons why they should.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>WOAH.

"More thanks to Piers Morgan and the text conversation he had with Caroline that consisted of three lines, no time signature and no context,’ Jameela wrote. "That was enough to hold me responsible for a woman’s death. And these are the types of men that follow him."</p><p>In speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Independent</a>, Piers suggested that Jameela was "playing the victim," and didn't deserve any sympathy.
