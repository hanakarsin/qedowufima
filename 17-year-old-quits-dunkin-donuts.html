While there seems to be a growing number of folks across the board <a href=#>who have voiced displeasure</a> with their jobs in general and have walked out the door as part of the "<a href=#>great resignation</a>," data shows that some lines of work have been harder by this phenomenon than others.</p><p>Namely, the food service industry, especially in fast and fast-casual chains, have struggled to maintain an adequate number of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">staff members to ensure that operations are running smoothly</a>. This has led to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">increased wait times</a> for customers and overworked employees as a result.</p><p>While there have been some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">signs of improvement</a> in this regard throughout 2022, there are still a number of workers who have vocally protested the amount of tasks they've being forced to complete in a single day, with many of them taking to social media to express their displeasure, even uploading footage of them quitting live as a result. Like TikToker @kellymariamm, a 17-year-old Dunkin' Donuts employee who walked out on her job.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kellymariamm href=#>@kellymariamm</a><p>@kellymariamm For some more context.. I was completely by myself at Dunkin NEAR A HIGHWAY because the owners didn't make the schedule correctly and no closers showed up and the girl that was working before had been working for 10 hours straight with no break and had to leave at 5:30 when she was supposed to get off at 4 and we kept letting the owners and manager know, but nothing was being done so I locked myself in the store and told them this is my last day and when the owner finally showed up all she cared about was me unlocking the doors. <a title=boycottdunkin href=#>#boycottdunkin</a> <a title=treatyouremployeesbetter href=#>#treatyouremployeesbetter</a> <a title=enoughisenough href=#>#enoughisenough</a> <a title=thegreatresignation href=#>#thegreatresignation</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - kelly üíÖüèæ" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - kelly üíÖüèæ</a> <span>Source: @kellymariamm</span></figure><p>In her video, Kelly states that as a minor she was forced to close the store by herself and said that the specific location she was working at violated numerous labor laws.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: @kellymariamm</span></figure><p>She writes in a caption for the now-viral clip: "For some more context..
