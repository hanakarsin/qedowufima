I stand by what I said: N3.7 trillion is not traced to any project in the 2024 Budget. I spoke for myself and not on behalf of the Northern Senator Forum. I never said the federal government is operating with two budgets. I only said N25 trillion was traced to projects and N3.7 trillion was not traced to any project.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the Presidency on Sunday stated that claims made by Senator Abdul Ningi, representing Bauchi Central, that President Bola Ahmed Tinubu-led Federal Government is operating two versions of the 2024 budget is false.</p><p>In a statement titled ‘THE FACTS ABOUT 2024 BUDGET’ obtained by <strong>Naija News</strong>, Special Adviser to the President on Information & Strategy, Bayo Onanuga, accused Senator Ningi of making wild claims.</p><p>He stated that the presidency considers it appropriate to inform Nigerians that there is no truth whatsoever in the allegation made by the lawmaker.</p><p>The statement reads in part: “To begin with, President Tinubu on November 29, 2023, presented a budget of N27.5 Trillion to the joint session of the National Assembly made up of N9.92 Trillion recurrent expenditure, Debt Service N8.25 Trillion, and Capital Expenditure N8.7 Trillion.</p><p>“This was widely reported. He did not present a budget of N25 Trillion.</p><p>“Contrary to the strange view expressed by Senator Ningi, there was no way the Senate could have debated and passed a N25 Trillion budget that was not presented to the National Assembly.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5BqZqKlXaeyorDYZp2oql2owrS8xKeqoqeeYsCmusCtpqtlnp67qLWMnKOaqpmbtqa%2FjKyrmqyVorKvwIyopWamY2KEbsDRoqOloZ%2BjerG%2BzqOcnKyjYraveZFpaW1lkqqxqLHTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./buhari-to-au-nigeria-will-continue-to-back-justice-democracy.html><span>←</span><span>Nigeria Will Continue To Back Justice, Democracy</span></a>
