Source: Getty ImagesActress Ellen Pompeo, who plays the titular Meredith Grey on Grey's Anatomy, has played this part since 2005. There have been plenty of near-death experiences for Meredith that would give Ellen a way out, but she always manages to bounce back.
However, the show recently took Meredith in a direction that might finally give Ellen an exit strategy."><meta name=author content="Hettie Henneman"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

But Ellen's role in Season 19 has been much more minimal and her character has been putting things in place to leave Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital for a new opportunity in Boston.</p><p>Yes, Meredith and Ellen are leaving.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Instagram post</a>, Ellen Pompeo said a short but sweet goodbye to fans of Grey's Anatomy while promising to occasionally pop back in.</p><p>"I am eternally grateful and humbled by the love and support you have all shown me, Meredith GREY, and the show for 19 seasons," she began. "Through it all...none of it...would have been possible without the best fans in the world. You all are RIDERS and you all have made the ride so fun and ICONIC!!"</p><p>Despite assuring us the show will go on, we're still left feeling pretty bummed.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ellen Pompeo (@ellenpompeo)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is Ellen Pompeo's last episode of 'Grey's Anatomy'?</h2><p>After of the Season 19 fall finale on Thursday, Nov. 10, ABC aired a promo announcing Meredith's final episode when the show returns for the second part of the season on Feb. 23. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, Ellen will remain an executive producer on the series and will continue to provide the episode voiceovers for the rest of Season 19.</p><p>The response to Ellen's official exit was predictably sad. Actor Luke Baines probably said it best when he commented under Ellen's Instagram post: "Sedate me."</p><p>Jaina Lee Ortiz, who plays Andy Herrera on the Grey's Anatomy spinoff Station 19, confusingly commented, "Daaaaamn girl," followed by several fire emojis. (To be fair, Ellen chose an incredible photo of herself for the farewell post.)</p><p>Social media was, of course, flooded with devastated reactions. Though most fans knew it was coming, we were not prepared for this. Twitter user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Collado</a> suggested this indicated that end times were nigh: "Twitter is ending. <a href=#>Ticketmaster's downfall</a> is near. Ellen Pompeo is leaving Grey's Anatomy. The world is shifting."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Twitter is ending. Ticketmaster's downfall is near.

Nick wasn't thrilled with the idea of Meredith leaving, but her plans were essentially set in stone now.</p><p>And if viewers had any doubts about Ellen sticking to her guns and leaving for good, the episode ended with Meredith's house literally up in flames when lightning struck a tree outside. If that isn't a metaphor for the end of an era, then we don't know what is.</p><p>Grey's Anatomy returns on Thursday, Feb. 23 at 9 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBusculnKdloKS6sbHOZqOemaaeu6h5xqucsqtdlruiwM6msA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./efcc-react-to-accusation-of-brutalizing-nollywood-actress-helen-aduru.html><span>←</span><span>EFCC React To Accusation Of Brutalizing Nollywood Actress, Helen Aduru</span></a>
