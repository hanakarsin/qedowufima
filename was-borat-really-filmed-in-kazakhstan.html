In the trailer, we see Borat attempt to gift his daughter to Vice President Mike Pence and even quarantine with alt-right republicans.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Amazon</span></figure><p>The second installment of the controversial film is already prompting headlines.&nbsp;</p><p>While audiences know that some of the film was shot in Los Angeles, Greenville, and other locations across the U.S., viewers are questioning if the scenes in Borat's village were actually filmed in Kazakhstan. Keep reading to find out more.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Was 'Borat' really filmed in Kazakhstan?</h2><p>In 2006, the film opened with the TV personality showing viewers around his "home" and his village in the country of Kazakhstan. But, according to the Dailymail, Borat was not filmed in Kazakhstan, but in a small Romanian village known as Glod.&nbsp;</p><p>With only 1,000 residents, no sewage or running water, the townspeople portrayed in the first film were reportedly not privy to the inside jokes that were being made at their expense.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Amazon</span></figure><p>Overall, Borat's sister aka "number 4 prostitute in all of Kazakhstan," the town abortionist, and etc., were reportedly natives who were paid just three euros to appear on-screen.</p><p>Following the film's release, a lawsuit was reportedly filed against 20th Century Fox and Sacha for how they were portrayed in the film. With many Glod residents reportedly upset, it is unlikely that the comedic actor returned to shoot Borat 2 scenes there.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">The people of Kazakhstan do not like Borat. Period.</h2><p>When audiences became aware of "Borat," Kazakh's were not so thrilled about how their country was being portrayed. Kazakh government spokesman Roman Vassilenko told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a> in 2006, "Mr. Cohen could not have been more wrong when he chose Kazakhstan as a home country for his mythical, misogynist and anti-Semitic reporter." Adding, "I am offended and the people of Kazakhstan are offended by the choice."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>If you see only one moviefilm this year, please see the only one that got made - mine.

"This movie (although I wouldn’t call this a movie) is an absolute disgrace to my country and my people. Some of you may find it funny or as joke, but TO US, the citizens of Kazakhstan, it really hurts our feelings," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one person commented</a> on Sacha's Instagram page.&nbsp;</p><p>The social media user continued: &nbsp;"As a country that is not so much famous among other nations, we work hard to earn recognition in the world. We don’t want to be recognized [because] of Borat, bc everything in the movie is NOT TRUE. I don’t want to be asked every time I introduce myself if everything in the movie is real and we live in that bad conditions. ... That’s why before praising something double check if it doesn’t hurt anyone else."&nbsp;</p><p>Borat 2 premieres on Amazon Prime on Oct. 23.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrK60ecGoqZqsXaeyorjLsmSfoZyisqV5yKdkpJmqlripv9OapQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./241517-mtangazaji-tajika-aeleza-sababu-hasa-iliyomfanya-kuondoka-k24-tv-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mtangazaji tajika aeleza sababu hasa iliyomfanya kuondoka K24 TV</span></a>
