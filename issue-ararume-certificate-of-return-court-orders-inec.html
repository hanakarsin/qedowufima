Daudu, in an application for a stay of judgment, informed the court that the suit was pending before the apex court for hearing and determination.</p><p>But Counsel to Ararume, Tunde Falola, said the suit at the Supreme Court had been withdrawn through a notice of withdrawal and copies served on all the defendants.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH10e5BxZqKro6qybq3RmqmupZVisKa%2B06KdopuRqbJuu8VmqZ6spae7bq%2FOrqmtZZ%2Bnsaa%2B0magp52TZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-grede-html.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Grede - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
