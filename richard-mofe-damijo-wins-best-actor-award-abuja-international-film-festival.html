It couldn’t have come at a better time as we wrap the #glolafftafest2017 today. It’s been a long comic ride since April. Laughter is good for the soul, and even the bible acknowledges that a heart that is cheerful is as “medicine for the soul…” which is why I love to laugh and be merry. Like laughter, awards are good for the soul especially when they are not post mortem. People ask me why I still get excited over awards in acting since I have won tons of them. Well, yes, I still get tickled by acting awards, It’s who I am, it’s what I do and I absolutely love it. It is my art and in it’s own way defines me, so any recognition of excellence ìs a validation that on my lane, I do good work. I adore and totally respect those who do same in their respective fields because when it all comes down to it, really, it’s how we impact our little corners that count. I am blessed and thankful that after 33 years of doing this work, I still hunger to be better everyday. My name is Richard Mofe-Damijo I am an actor, grateful for the liberty to express myself through my craft. Who are you?</a></p><p>A post shared by Richard Mofe-Damijo RMD (@mofedamijo) on Oct 15, 2017 at 5:21am PDT</p><p>The 56-year old actor has several movies to his credit.</p><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/92fe902b5e55c44c957041e847c95c76?s=60&d=retro&r=g" height=60 width=60 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Passionate writer, content provider, inspired by the opportunity to learn new things.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Naija-News-Logo.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span class=mvp-ad-label>Advertisement</span><h4 class=mvp-widget-home-title><span class=mvp-widget-home-title>You may like</span></h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWlnZH5xe5BwZquhk52us7CMpqafnV2Zrq61yahksKGeqHqjsdKtZJqbpKS%2Fbq3WmqmdZZGXwqutjKKlrZ2io661tc6nmKVllp65rnnFnqqtoaaWuXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./402310-oscar-sudi-slashes-jubilee-party-monthly-contribution-ksh-10k-ksh-50-bob-html.html><span>←</span><span>Oscar Sudi slashes his Jubilee Party monthly contribution from KSh 10K to KSh 50 bob</span></a>
