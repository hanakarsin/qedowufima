Source: TikTokThere are fewer things more gut-wrenching than a ruined relationship. It could be a friendship, a working partnership, or a great (or toxic) romance, and when that's over, it could be pretty tough to deal with the aftermath. Mostly because there's a war between what we feel like we want to do (which is usually rooted in absolute emotional chaos) and what we know in our hearts we should do."><meta name=author content="Almeda Bohannan"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It could be a friendship, a working partnership, or a great (or toxic) romance, and when that's over, it could be pretty tough to deal with the aftermath. Mostly because there's a war between what we feel like we want to do (which is usually rooted in absolute emotional chaos) and what we know in our <a href=#>hearts</a> we should do.</p><p>The problem arises is when we attempt to intellectually justify those feelings, which initially are probably pretty bad, and we fib our way into an argument we negatively delude ourselves into thinking is what we should do. Sound complicated? Let's simplify.</p><p>Example: we know it's not a good idea to drunkenly call our ex. But after we go through enough mental gymnastics for a few minutes, we somehow conclude that maybe doing just that is the type of crazy profession we need to make to get them to want to be with us again.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>And when a former best friend of yours perhaps stops being there for you all the time, or "falls off" and the two of your drift apart, or maybe explode one another, resulting in a fight-ending argument that's impossible to recover from, then a lot of bitterness can set in.</p><p>And bitterness can cause people to do some absolutely crazy things that are objectively things you should not do, like stand on the porch of a former friend's house unannounced despite being told multiple times to leave.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@thebarbarbinks href=#>@thebarbarbinks</a><p>part 1? story time? <a title=messytiktok href=#>#messytiktok</a> <a title=messytok href=#>#messytok</a> <a title=karen href=#>#karen</a> <a title=karensgoingwild href=#>#karensgoingwild</a> <a title=tresspassing href=#>#tresspassing</a> <a title=crazybitch href=#>#crazybitch</a> <a title=narctok href=#>#narctok</a> <a title=narcissist href=#>#narcissist</a> <a title=friendbreakup href=#>#friendbreakup</a> <a title=drama href=#>#drama</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Barbara Clark" href=#>♬ original sound - Barbara Clark</a></figure><p>The clip was posted by Barbara Clark (@thebarbarbinks) on TikTok.

But things get even more dramatic as Barbara had left some items over at her former friend's house.</p><p>You figure the two of them would just exchange whatever they had left at one another's homes and that would be the end of it all, right?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>However, this wasn't the case whatsoever. According to Barbara, she offered to bring back her former friend's stuff in exchange for the things she left at PK's house.</p><p>But PK and her husband refused Barbara's deal, insisting that Barbara only bring their belongings without her picking up her stuff.</p><p>I guess to pay for all of the emotional damage of being her friend and whatnot.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Fast forward to the rumors of Barbara "burning" PK's belongings.

Folks sure do love a mess, don't they?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Some pointed out that PK had no right to threaten to call the police, too, because her belongings are technically now Barbara's, if you want to go by the whole "if no one claims it for 30 days" rule.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>What do you think?
