The new TBS reality show is set at a wellness retreat — but don't expect to see social distancing.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TBS</span></figure><p>Have you been craving a reality show that takes place at a wellness retreat? If the answer is yes, then you’re in luck! The new <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TBS series Lost Resort</a> premieres on July 23, and follows nine "guests" as they work through their personal issues with a team of alternative healers.</p><p>The methods used to help this group of strangers embark on their journeys of self-discovery require a lot of touching and hand-holding, leading us to question when these 10 episodes <a href=#>were filmed</a> given the global health crisis we currently find ourselves in. Here’s what we learned from the cast.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When was 'Lost Resort' filmed for TBS?</h2><p>We were unable to find specific dates, but according to Reiki master Atasiea, the series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was shot</a> this past winter "before the drama in the 'real world' got extra crazy." He also revealed that cameras were rolling "24/7 for a month straight."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TBS</span></figure><p>When TBS picked up the show in January, the network confirmed that production on Season 1 had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">already wrapped</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Atasiea teased one of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his practices</a> on Instagram, sharing a photo from a "soundbath" infused with Reiki, or energy healing. "They zoned out to receive the #soundhealing frequencies of the singing bowls being played by a guest healer from Bali," the spiritual guidance counselor explained.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where was 'Lost Resort' filmed?</h2><p>The three-week retreat took place at the Bodhi Tree Yoga Resort in Nosara, Costa Rica. The village is known for its Pacific beaches, which attract surfers year round.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TBS</span></figure><p>The resort, which features "Balinese-inspired grounds," has just nine guest rooms but also includes three yoga shalas, two fitness shalas, a salt-water pool, and a restaurant.</p><p>For wellness coach Benjamin, the location isn’t as important as the people. "Healing happens in community," he recently wrote <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Instagram</a>. "Whatever that may look like — it is not done alone… Take time to tune in to the subtle and watch magic manifest around you."</p><p>In a separate post about the series, Benjamin added, "The beautiful people that showed up did some serious work. It was a transformative experience that I am grateful to have been a part of. Big love!"</p><p>Retreat leader Chrissie offered up a similar sentiment. "Three solid weeks of seriously transformative work with a gorgeous group of people who were pretty much entirely fresh to this kind of thing," she captioned a couple of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">behind-the-scenes photos</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TBS</span></figure><p>"God BLESS this excellent group of humans who seriously showed up for the wildest experience with me, bringing their experience, their love, their gifts, and supporting me beautifully."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cast member Thea</a>, who admits to having "deep-rooted issues with men," said she’s "nervous as heckkkk" to watch the series, but is hopeful that the integrity and intention of the show shines through.&nbsp;</p><p>"I truly believe that God will use each of our journeys [at] this retreat to help others find healing and peace," she wrote on social media. "We were all there for healing and we all left smelling like sage and with a [newfound] hope. I think the world is ready for this change."</p><p>New episodes of Lost Resort air Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET on TBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmuoywmKxlnKTAtXnRnqqoqqRis6q4zJ6bZqySqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sheik-gumi-visits-notorious-bandits-in-zamfara-forests.html><span>←</span><span>Sheik Gumi Visits Notorious Bandits In Zamfara Forests</span></a>
