As for me, I am not a coward to run away from EFCC, if they come for me I will follow them. I don’t have any investment in Europe all I have are in this state.</p><p>“If anyone accuses me of committing any crime let the person come and show me how it happened because I have nothing to fear and I have no skeleton in my cupboard.”</p><p>Ortom insists that he was not dissolving his cabinet. He asked his Commissioners to stay put on their jobs until the day of the handover.</p><p>“By noon of May 29 when the new government takes over everyone will formally vacate their positions.
