In early 2020 there were two adjournments, and between 24 March 2020 and 4 May 2020, court sittings were suspended on account of COVID 19. The high court and court of appeal only returned to full operation on September 28, 2020, it stated.</p><p>By October 2020, one of the claimants said that it was becoming clear to all the lenders that the negotiations were stalling and although some lenders continued to hope that they would be successful, others began to doubt that there would be a successful restructuring.</p><p>On November 23, 2020, an attempt by the CEO of Sterling Bank, one of the lenders, to break the impasse with the borrower failed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e49xZqydppq7brrIoJyroZGjeqOtzaSqZqeknbKzv4ybmK2snJp6orXTnqZmp6aav25%2BwadkpaeRo3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-riley-html.html><span>←</span><span>Robert Christopher Riley - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
