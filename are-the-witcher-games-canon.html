These five works make up the "official" Witcher saga, but there's also a standalone book called Season of Storms that also informs the narrative of the popular Netflix series.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>‚Äúthere can‚Äôt be a ciri game cus there are 3 different endings in tw3‚Äù okay and i care because? it‚Äôs not even that hard to just say the witcher one is canon which it is <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nbOu2KvRza</a></p>‚Äî mar (@IostIegacy) <a href=#>March 23, 2022</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">So why aren't the games considered apart of 'The Witcher' official canon?</h2><p>This is mainly because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sapkowski says that they aren't</a>. He has referred to the games as "free adaptations containing elements of his work" and "alternative versions" of the stories that he's crafted. And since The Witcher is his intellectual property, even though art has a way of evolving outside of an artist's control, what he says effectively goes when it comes to his vision for the story.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CD Projekt RED doesn't consider the games as canon either</a>: "It's true that the game was based on the popularity of the Witcher novels, so there's no sense in wondering what came first, the chicken or the egg. In this case, the books and the author are both of those things."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>you do realize that none of the Witcher games even remotely stuck to the canon, right?</p>‚Äî Ciri üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è Kuraion (@ChrapavyM) <a href=#>March 23, 2022</a></figure><p>The developer continued, "We want to develop The Witcher's universe in other media, not only video games.
