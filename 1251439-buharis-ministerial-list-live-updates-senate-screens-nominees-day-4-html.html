He says serving Buhari for three and half years as minister had been the high-point of his career.</p><p class=align-left>He speaks on the killings of Nigerians in South Africa and how he met with the country's authorities. He says he discovered a trust deficit between the country's police and Nigerians resident there. He also discloses that he and the South African authorities came up with solutions to ensure the building of confidence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/95e751d2524f9ff8.jpeg><p class=align-left>Onyeama says the South African government is not really complicit in the challenge and that there should be speed of action, part of which the former is working on.</p><p class=align-left>He recalls what the immediate past administration of President Buhari achieved internationally while he headed the foreign affairs ministry with specific mention of Ghana, Benin and some others.</p><p class=align-left>Lawan stresses that Nigeria cannot condone the killings in South Africa and that he had taken steps to reach out to the South African authorities over it. He asks what Onyeama thinks can be done about this.</p><p class=align-left>Ovie Omo-Agege counters Onyeama's claim that the South African government is not complicit in the killings. According to him, the country's government has the responsibility to protect the lives and properties of every resident. He also complained about the welfare of workers at the Nigerian embassies, some of whom have not been paid for two years.</p><p class=align-left>Aside this, Omo-Agege also notes the difficulties Nigerians face with the embassies.</p><p class=align-left>Onyeama agrees that payment of salaries had been the bane of Nigeria's missions. According to him, the challenges facing the embassies are many and salary is just one of them. He says it is just necessary to reduce the amount of foreign missions and employees.</p><p class=align-left>He also says the only way to resolve the issue of embassies collecting money from applicants and refusing to grant them visa is for Nigeria to reciprocate.</p><p class=align-left>Former deputy Senate president, Ike Ekweremadu, commends Onyeama for his achievements as minister. He also gives his consent to his renomination and asks his colleagues to confirm him.</p><p class=align-left>His colleague, Chimaroke Nnamani supports Ekweremadu in his prayer to his colleagues.</p><p class=align-left>Onyeama is asked to take a bow and go.

He notes that he has spent many years working in the oil and gas sector of the country.</p><p class=align-left>He possesses two masters degrees in business administration, one from the University of Benin, Benin-City with specialization in management and the other from Arizona state university, Tempe, Arizona, USA with specialization in supply chain management.</p><p class=align-left>The nominee also served as the commissioner in the Edo state ministry of environment and public utilities from January 23, 2009 to July 25, 2010.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/5c18910cd0da0cd0.jpeg><p class=align-left>The nominee says Nigeria can fix its refineries and that the country has the needed capacities and capabilities to do this.</p><p class=align-left>He also describes gully erosion as man-made and behavioural adding that Nigerian need to be enlightened on how to stop it as well as its consequences.</p><p class=align-left>Lawan invites the three senators from Edo to speak on the nomination of Agba. They all agree that he has the capacity to contribute to the development of Nigeria under the administration of Buhari.</p><p class=align-left>He is asked to take a bow and go.

He pleads that she be allowed to take a bow and go.</p><p class=align-left>Ahmad Lawan notes that Katagum is the last of the female nominees to be screened. He says the Senate's decision on soft landing for the female nominees had not been a mistake since they have all shown that they know what they are going to do as ministers.</p><p class=align-left>He notes that while the nominee recalls how she attended a functional public school, the situation is no longer the same as at least 11 million children are out of school. He said the country needs serious government expenditure and investments to eliminate the out-of-school challenge facing the country.</p><p class=align-left>He puts it to vote on whether the nominee should take a bow and go and the decision is favourable. The nominee takes a bow and is led out of the chamber.</p><p><span class="c-article-info__time c-article-info__time--clock-red">Jul 29 4:34 PM</span></p><h3>Ministerial nominee from Jigawa state: Suleiman Adamu</h3><p class=align-left>Suleiman Adamu, President Buhari's ministerial nominee from Jigawa state, is now before the Senate for his screening.</p><p class=align-left>Adamu is the former minister of water resources.
