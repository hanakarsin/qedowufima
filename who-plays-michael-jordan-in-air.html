The company was launched by world-famous <a href=#>NBA</a> star <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a>, whose entrepreneurial journey is depicted in the 2023 feature film Air. Starring <a href=#>Matt Damon</a>, <a href=#>Viola Davis</a>, <a href=#>Chris Tucker</a>, and <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a>, the movie is set to release Wednesday, April 5. But who plays Michael Jordan in Air? Read to find out!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who plays Michael Jordan in ‘Air’? Here’s everything we know about actor Damian Delano Young.</h2><p>In Air, Michael is played by Damian Delano Young. His breakout role in the film comes after he was cast in Strictly for the Streets Vol. 2 on Amazon <a href=#>Prime Video</a> and the short film Prom Night Flex, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>.</p><p>However, in Air, Damian’s Michael is a man of few words.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although Damian portrays Michael, his appearances in the film are rare as he’s either seen in the background or from behind. Ben, who stars as Phil Knight and also directed Air, shared the real reason why they chose to keep Damian’s face out-of-frame for the majority of the movie with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS Sunday Morning</a>.</p><p>According to him, the decision was made out of the film’s deep-rooted dedication to authenticity.</p><p>“This is a movie about an icon, about somebody who is so meaningful that the minute I show you somebody and tell you, ‘Hey, that’s Michael Jordan,’ you're just gonna go, 'No it isn’t. I know what Michael Jordan is, I know what he is,” he told the outlet.</p><p>“And not only that, but the only actor Michael Jordan was a little old to play this part, and we probably couldn’t afford him. But the idea was, if I show you … you know that’s not Michael Jordan. And now everything else is fake,” he added.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Air might be <a href=#>based on a true story</a>, but it details Michael’s partnership with Nike more than it does his life. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture</a> purports that Damian only has two lines in the film: “Bulls colors” and “Hello.”</p><p>You can (kind of) see Damian in Air, premiering in theaters on Wednesday, April 5.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwec%2BlmLKrXaK2pLTAnqNmop%2BnsaK6jKKlZpmZpw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hogwarts-legacy-balloon-locations.html><span>←</span><span>Trying to Find Every Balloon in 'Hogwarts Legacy'?
