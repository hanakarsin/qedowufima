She was born on December 25, 1995. Today, Hailie Jade Scott-Mathers age is 24. She grew up in Detroit, Michigan, USA, together with her sisters Alaina Marie Mathers and Whitney Scott Mathers.</p><p class=align-left>Alaina is Eminem’s adopted daughter, while Whitney is Kimberly’s daughter with Eric Hartter.

Nelson-Mathers and Bruce Marshall Mathers, while Kathleen Sluck and Casimer Sluck were her grandparents through Kim.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4e944a17e77b9a3a.png><p class=align-left>Hailie has not enjoyed a blissful upbringing as you would expect of a child of a celebrity rapper. Her parents had a difficult relationship after her birth, and sometimes, they could not give her the attention she deserved.</p><p class=align-left>One year after Hailie’s birth, the couple parted ways. However, they got back together after a few years and tied the knot. The union did not last long as Eminem filed for divorce, accusing Hailie Jade mom of unfaithfulness. Eminem and Kim would then again reunite in 2006, but the relationship would not go past four months as they called it quits again.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f101b0bca1bd666e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dove Cameron’s dating history: a look into the singer’s love life</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As of today, Eminem and Kimberly are divorced, although Hailie Jade Scott maintains close contact with both parents. Eminem once said that even though they have not lived the life they would like Hailie to emulate, as parents, they try to instill good values in their daughter. She attributes her success to her parents, saying that they played a significant role in shaping her life.</p><h2>Education</h2><p class=align-left>Hailie started <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">her education</a> at Cherokee Elementary School. The majority of celebrities’ kids go to posh privately owned schools, but this was not Hailie’s case, who went to a public school. After her elementary <a href=#>education</a>, she proceeded to join Chippewa Valley High School, where she excelled and graduated in 2014.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f48362da0317eb5d.jpg><p class=align-left>She was enrolled at Michigan State University, where she studied Psychology.
