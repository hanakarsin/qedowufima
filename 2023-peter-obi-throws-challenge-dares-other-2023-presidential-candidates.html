When people fault my figures, I tell them and other candidates to present theirs.</p><p>“Brazil is among the five biggest producers of food globally. They have developed agriculture, they are feeding themselves and exporting.</p><p>“People asked me how do we get the naira strong against the dollar. My answer remains moving Nigeria from consumption to production.</p><p>“What will give dollars is production, Nigeria is not a producing country. It is not natural resources or space that will generate money, it is the production capacity of the people.”</p><p>He also spoke on the security challenges plaguing the country, revealing that he had companies in Kano and regularly visited the locations.</p><p>“I used to drive to Kano, all over the country. But today, you really cannot do that because of the level of insecurity.</p><p>“We want to change that; we want to stop politics of sharing money, stealing and sending children to schools abroad,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FsZmtoYmh6sbHTnqlmp5KeerW00aiurGWTna6tuMSnnp5llJa%2Fpr%2BMqKuhnaJif3F%2Bkmanq52jnrGmutOimKVlk5a7pbXDmqueq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./369589-ariana-grande-dating-history-ariana-dated-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ariana Grande dating history: who has Ariana dated?</span></a>
