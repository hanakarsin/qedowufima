But Duff has also appeared all over network television, from Iron Chef America to <a href=#>The Masked Singer</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>This isn't Duff’s first time judging—he's judged most of the Baking Championship shows and even cohosted <a href=#>Kids Baking Championship</a>. In 2018, Duff married Johanna Colbry, and in 2021, his daughter, Josephine Frances Goldman, was born. He’s spoken often about his Jewish faith and how it inspires him to give back through Tzedakah.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Carla Hall</h2><p>Known for her appearances on Seasons 5 and 8 of Top Chef, <a href=#>Carla Hall</a> was also the cohost of The Chew, which premiered in 2011 on ABC. Before pursuing her culinary career, Carla was a model on the runways of Paris, Milan, and London despite being born and raised in Nashville, Tenn. She started her own company, Alchemy Caterers, in Wheaton, Md., and wrote the cookbook, Cooking with Love: Comfort Food that Hugs You.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Carla opened her own restaurant, Carla Hall’s Southern Kitchen, in Brooklyn in 2016, but the restaurant only lasted until 2017. Even still, she’s made several television appearances, including as a judge on <a href=#>Halloween Baking Championship</a> and <a href=#>Crazy Delicious</a>. Now, Carla lives in Washington, D.C. with her husband, Matthew Lyons, and stepson Noah.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Damaris Phillips</h2><p>While Carla and Duff have had their fair share of television and baking experience, Damaris Phillips *literally* took the cake by winning Food Network Star Season 9. She then hosted Southern at Heart on the Food Network for five seasons and cohosted The Bobby and Damaris Show with <a href=#>Bobby Flay</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Since then, she’s also appeared as a judge on Guy’s Grocery Games and Kids BBQ Championship, so this is her first foray into the realm of judging a baking-specific contest. When she competes, Damaris often raises money for the story program in Louisville, Ky. Born in Louisville, she still lives there with her now-husband, Darrick Wood.</p><p>Now that we know the judges, let’s see what these contestants can do!</p><p>New episodes of Summer Baking Championship air Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on the Food Network.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMKuucSrZJuZm567qHnCoZimqJmku7S0yKlko62UnLK0</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wales-coach-ryan-giggs-charged-with-assault.html><span>←</span><span>Wales Coach, Ryan Giggs Charged With Assault</span></a>
