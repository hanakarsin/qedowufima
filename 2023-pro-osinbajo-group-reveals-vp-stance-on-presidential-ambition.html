For us, we know Osinbajo is contesting and will declare soon.</p><p>“Credible intelligence at our disposal points to elements working tirelessly to misinform people with the view to damping their hopes that Osinbajo will join the 2023 presidential race.</p><p>“Why they chose this route remains a mystery to us. We, on our part, think democracy is about inclusion and freedom of choice. We then wonder why anyone or group thinks it’s a good strategy to discourage people, especially Osinbajo’s supporters, from supporting him for the exalted office.</p><p>“We noticed there was a deliberate effort to misconstrue a statement from Osinbajo’s spokesperson, Laolu Akande, who said VP is only focused on the tasks he’s elected to do. This cannot mean Osinbajo is not interested in running for the office of President except one is just being plainly dishonest.</p><p>“We need not remind Nigerians that as a sitting Vice President, Osinbajo enjoys the right of first refusal when it comes to the All Progressive Congress (APC) ticket. So, the obviously fabricated report that he can deny his ambition shows the desperation of some of these integrity-challenged politicians.</p><p>“We urge Nigerians to completely disregard this worthless piece of article issued in bad faith and keep it where it truly belongs, the trash bin.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5BvZmtoYmh6sb7OZqasoZ6Xrqu7jKCpqK2gYr%2BmwsSao6xlpqV6tMDAp5qeZZ%2BjerG%2BxKygnZ2eqbaiuIyapJuhpJ68r3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./northern-can-disowns-dogara-babachir-over-muslim-muslim-ticket.html><span>←</span><span>Northern CAN Disowns Dogara, Babachir Over Muslim-Muslim Ticket</span></a>
