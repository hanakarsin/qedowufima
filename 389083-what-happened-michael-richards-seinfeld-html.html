He is remembered for playing Cosmos Kramer in <i>Seinfeld</i>, which was a hit sitcom television series. The sitcom aired on NBC for close to a decade, where he was an integral part of its cast.

So, what happened to Michael Richards?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/42d93de40458e465.jpeg><p class=align-left>Undoubtedly, the showbiz scene has its own challenges, and fame is one of them. Failure to manage fame adequately has seen many successful celebrities lose their worthy careers. For instance, a "slip of the tongue" by Michael Richards has been haunting him for years.</p><h2>What happened to Michael Richards?</h2><p class=align-left>The legendary actor and comedian has been away from the showbiz scene for years, forcing fans to ask themselves endless answered questions. Where did Michael Richards go after Seinfeld? Below is a detailed summary that will help you to find the answers to your questions.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4f18da9befdaee2d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jenny Jones murder updates, documentary, and lawsuit update</span></p></a><h3>1998: The end of Seinfeld</h3><p class=align-left>Richards enjoyed a <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/387407-meet-worlds-richest-families-who-net-worth.html href=#>successful career</a> starring as Kramer on <i>Seinfeld</i>. The actor was a darling for many movie lovers up to 1998. He did not only become a star on the show but also won several awards due to his role.</p><p class=align-left>Interestingly, he bagged more Emmys than any other actor who starred on the sitcom by the time it ended in 1998 – he is a three-time winner of the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (1993, 1994, and 1997).</p><h3>2000: The Michael Richards Show</h3><p class=align-left>In 2000, he created <i>The Michael Richards Show</i> alongside other <a href=#>creative people</a>. Unfortunately, the show was cancelled a few months after its premiere. The show received poor ratings, forcing the network to cancel it.</p><p class=align-left>Another factor that led to the cancellation of the show was competition. During the time, his show was competing with <i>JAG</i>, <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</i>, and <i>That ‘70s Show</i>. They had better <a href=#>audience ratings</a> as compared to his show.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1a5db92cd3b797e1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mike and Molly cast members in 2021: Where are they now?</span></p></a><h3>2006: The racist rant</h3><p class=align-left>Michael started to concentrate on stand-up comedy. He made regular appearances on <i>Laugh Factory</i> – a chain of comedy club established by Jaime Masada. However, in 2006, he was involved in an incident that has been haunting him for years.</p><p class=align-left>What exactly is known about the Michael Richards scandal? The incident happened when the comedian was performing to a Laugh Factory audience in California.</p><p class=align-left>While on stage, a black audience accompanied with a few Mexicans walked in while the <a href=#>comedian</a> was performing. Before settling down, they started to order drinks. In the process, they caused a little bit of noise and disturbance, forcing him to interrupt his monologue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4f18da9befdaee2d.jpeg><p class=align-left>He started to yell at them in an attempt to restore calm in the room. However, the incident escalated when he used an N-word on the black man. He continuously shouted the offensive word, angering the black audience.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/aa92f28974e9acef.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Chris Hansen of 'To Catch a Predator'?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Some of them started to leave. While leaving, one of them tried to get back at him; telling him that he was not funny. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Quoting him</a>,</p>It’s not funny, that’s why you’re a reject, never had no shows, never had no movies, Seinfeld that’s it.<p class=align-left>The comedian sarcastically replied,</p>Oh, I guess you got me there. You’re absolutely right. I’m just a wash up. Gotta stand on the stage.<p class=align-left>The confrontation became worse, forcing him to leave the stage. Later, Frazer Smith, who was the host, came on the stage and apologized for the incident.</p><h3>2013: Failed attempt to return to TV</h3><p class=align-left>Over the years, Michael has been suffering because of his racial remarks. He lost a considerable following after the incident. Also, many entertainers started to distance themselves from him in fear of suffering the same consequences.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1a5db92cd3b797e1.jpeg><p class=align-left>Immediately after the incident, he took a voluntary break from the entertainment scene. Perhaps, he wanted the situation to cool down, but that did not happen. In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Time</a>, the actor said,</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/cd5113b69aeef6bb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 greatest black comedians from the 70s who were so funny</span></p></a>I took up photography, [did] a lot of reading, a lot of writing and I travelled a bit.<p class=align-left>In 2013, he attempted to make a return to TV but he failed. He played Frank Baxter in Kristie. The show was cancelled after one season. Its cancellation continued to hurt his career – he continued to lose relevance due to his inconsistency.</p><p class=align-left>In other words, the consequences have continued to haunt him forever. He has tried to give his side of the story as well as apologizing. Unfortunately, his apology is yet to be accepted by some people who felt offended by his remarks.</p><p class=align-left>Previously, he also made an appearance in <i>Bee Movie</i> (2007) as Bud Ditchwater and <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> (2009) as Michael Richards. Even so, he was still keeping a low profile during the time.</p><h2>What is Michael Richards doing now?</h2><p class=align-left>The comedian has been low-key since his 2013 TV return failed. He has been taking care of his family.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/582a3e46324a256f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Deadliest Catch deaths: How many guys have died on the show?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/f71c43e5fec4f566.jpeg><p class=align-left>So, who is Michael Richards wife? One may ask. Since 2013, he has been married to Beth Skipp. The couple is blessed with one son by the name Antonio Baz Richards. He was born in 2011, meaning he is currently 9 years old.</p><p class=align-left>Previously, the comedian was married to Cathleen Lyons (in 1974). Their union resulted in the birth one of one child – a daughter by the name Sophia Richards. The two <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">divorced in</a> 1992. This makes the number of Michael Richards kids to be two.</p><p class=align-left>Also, in July 2020, Kramer from <i>Seinfeld</i> was spotted in Las Angeles. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the pictures </a>that have been making rounds on social media, Richards looks noticeably different.</p><p class=align-left>One can hardly recognize him because he has grown beards all over his face. He was relaxing in the trunk of his <a href=# title>SUV car</a> after a biking experience in the city.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b3b28e7badb350fd.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Aaron Goodwin net worth: How much does the Ghost Adventures star earn</span></p></a><p class=align-left>We hope that now you know what happened to Michael Richards. His absence from the limelight has been a big blow to the fans who loved his work. The legendary actor and stand-up comedian enjoyed massive success while starring in <i>Seinfeld</i> and <i>Laugh Factory</i>.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> recently shared a detailed post on what happened between <a href=#>Angelina Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton</a>. The two celebrities became the talk of the town in the early 2000s after tying the knot in Las Vegas. Each of them left their partners, who they were then dating, to marry each other.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, two years down the line, they started having troubles with their marriage. Eventually, they resolved to part ways. According to Billy, their marriage ended because they could not keep up with each other’s lifestyles. However, they still talk to each other.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2Fl3JncWtdrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnMopqhmZWherO1wqGYq5yjYsCmtc2fnKWcXp3Brrg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./todd-howard-html.html><span>←</span><span>Todd Howard - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
