The two are now the focal point of the TLC reality series <a href=#>The Family Chantel.</a></p><p>Since TLC introduced fans to Chantel and Pedro on 90 Day Fiancé, viewers have watched as Chantel introduced Pedro to her family and the aftermath of their marriage. The ups and downs of their relationship have been something that has always kept fans engaged in the series. However, there has been one particular quirk of the couple that has caught the attention of fans. Pedro consistently calls his wife Chantel by the nickname <a href=#>“Pinky Winky.”</a> So, why does Pedro do this?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Chantel and Pedro met when she was looking to improve her Spanish speaking ability.</h2><p>Chantel met Pedro Jimeno while she was on a trip to the Dominican Republic after being introduced by a Spanish teacher. Chantel and Pedro continued a long-distance relationship, and she went to the Dominican Republic to visit him frequently. On one of her trips to visit Pedro, he proposed.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>After the two got engaged, Chantel worried that her family would think that Pedro was only involved with Chantel for a green card so that he could enter the U.S. This is a pretty typical worry of any participant on 90 Day Fiancé. To avoid suspicion from her family, she told them that Pedro was in America on a student travel visa.</p><p>Eventually, Chantel and Pedro did get married in the U.S. Things were going okay with Chantel’s family until Pedro’s family also became involved in the relationship. Pedro revealed that now that he was living in the U.S., his family now expected him to send them money.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Chantel's family felt it was not fair that Pedro’s family benefited from Chantel in the Dominican Republic while Chantel and Pedro lived very modestly in the United States. Despite all the family issues, Pedro and Chantel are still married and living in Georgia.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Pedro continually calls Chantel by the nickname “Pinky Winky.”</h2><p>As fans have watched Pedro and Chantel’s life together through the magic of reality television, fans have noticed that Pedro calls Chantel by a very strange nickname. An entire <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit thread</a> was dedicated to the fact that Pedro has this name for Chantel. “Ever notice Pedro's nickname for Chantel is Pinky …” the Redditor wrote.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My sister: why doesn’t Pedro call Chantel Pinky?<br>Me: maybe because shes Pinky and he’s the Brain <a href=#>#90DayFiance</a></p>— PostMonlone (@Mon1caLionheart) <a href=#>May 29, 2018</a></figure><p>TLC even confirmed the two had nicknames for each other in a tweet. “Pedro and Chantel have nicknames for each other. Chantel calls Pedro 'Pepe Wepe' and Pedro calls Chantel 'Pinky Winky'. #90DayFiance,” the official network tweeted.</p><p>The two recorded a short video detailing their time together during the first couple of months of quarantine. In the video, Chantel admits that she wishes she had more space to herself and seems a bit annoyed with her husband.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pedro and Chantel have nicknames for each other. Chantel calls Pedro “Pepe Wepe” and Pedro calls Chantel “Pinky Winky”. <a href=#>#90DayFiance</a></p>— TLC Network (@TLC) <a href=#>July 8, 2019</a></figure><p>"I'm really tired of being in the house, it's just so claustrophobic to me," she explains. "I love my husband but I do wish I had my own space. He has his gaming station, and we never anticipated me having to move all of my studies from the school library into the home."</p><p>The camera is then being operated by Pedro, as he bursts into her room while she lies in bed, yelling "Pinky Winky!"&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">No one really knows why Pedro calls Chantel “Pinky Winky.”</h2><p>So, why does Pedro call his wife by the nickname “Pinky Winky”? That seems to still be a mystery. While many fans have questioned the nickname and its origin, there doesn't seem to be a definitive answer.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In the same short video the couple made for TLC network’s social media, it seems that Chantel does like the color pink. In the footage, you can see that her blanket, shirt, pillows, and many other decor items in her home are the color pink. The nickname could possibly stem from her love for the color.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxloJqxs7uMnJilpF2YtaK6056jZqiZo7i6edaipaSx</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./firefighters-water-bottle-car-danger.html><span>←</span><span>Water Bottles Start Fires in Cars</span></a>
