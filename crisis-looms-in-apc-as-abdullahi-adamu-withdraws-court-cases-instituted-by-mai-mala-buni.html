Consequently, the party is not interested in pursuing the appeal in respect of the above matter.</p><p>“I have further instructions of the national legal adviser to request that you withdraw all the processes filed on behalf of the party and H.E. Mai Mala Buni, the erstwhile national chairman of the CECPC, at the Court of Appeal.”</p><p>It was gathered APC had begun the process of withdrawing all the cases from the Court of Appeal.</p><p>Speaking to The PUNCH, top APC sources warned Senator Abdullahi Adamu against reversing moves by Buni, warming it may lead to massive defection and crisis.</p><p>“The best thing for Senator Adamu to have done was to allow the cases to run their course. There are over 200 cases in court at the moment. He should have let them continue,” an APC chieftain said.</p><p>“What the new national chairman is doing now is to reverse Buni’s actions and those who feel slighted will be forced to leave the party.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e49yZpyqmai2tHnLqKamq12eu26tz5xkmqtdlq%2BlwculmKGhXZaxornUZq6irJiZv6LD0maaqK2iqXqkrdKeqmahnqjBqsDUrZydZZKueq6tyGakmqSRYq%2B2usho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./humans-can-be-ok.html><span>←</span><span>Company Manufactures 500 Copies of Discontinued Cup for Autistic Teen</span></a>
