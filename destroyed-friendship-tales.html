One time, I had a close friend but we ended up moving to different cities and kind of lost touch. I know that isn't a great story, or even a story, but it is the most personal example I can give.
I hope this doesn't come across as cocky, but I am generally a nice person who doesn't treat other people poorly."><meta name=author content="Hettie Henneman"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Stopped replying to texts, stopped returning calls. I was worried for a while, thinking something bad happened to her. Then I noticed she had blocked me on Facebook. We had been close friends for almost 10 years. There were no signs, no argument, no conflict, everything was just as it had been for years. Then one day she was suddenly gone from my life. It's been 3 years now and I still have no clue why. I respect her choice, but I really wish I could have some explanation, some kind of closure.<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ybjdjkjo</strong></a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">I hope she isn't happy with her new choir friends.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>greenbathmat's comment from discussion "How did your friend destroy the friendship?"</a>.</figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">I thought the lateness would be the worst part.

Fucking hell.<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>generic_username_pun</strong></a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">I get the ending. It's tricky.</h2>On her 21st birthday I went out with her, me and one other were the only people who showed up. She was my best friend for eight years. She rented the duplex next to me when we moved to a new city together. I got too drunk during the bar crawl, I went to the bathroom to throw up. I come back to the bar and she's gone, the two guys she was speaking to were gone as well. She took my jacket which had my house keys and my wallet. Hail down a cab, promise the driver I'll pay him when I get my wallet at home. Get home, she's refusing to answer the door. Won't answer her phone. I call this guy I just started seeing and give an explanation, he offers to have the cab driver take me there. 40$ cab fare that he paid, and I had work in five hours. He drives me home in the morning and my friend pretends like nothing happened. I realized then our entire friendship was always revolved around her and I couldn't remember a time she was there for me, but always me being there for her. But since then I've never had a friend to talk to everyday like I did with her. My life is much more lonely, it's weird.<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>catalessi</strong></a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How dare you?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Isa624's comment from discussion "How did your friend destroy the friendship?"</a>.</figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Yeah.
