Only the living can benefit from the processes of democracy,” he said.</p><p>“(We want to) ensure that people play the game according to the rules. We are here to extend the good voices of Nigerians and to let the people of Ekiti know that Nigerians are solidly behind them.”</p><p>Kukah disclosed that so far, the people of Ekiti have acted in a peaceful manner. He, therefore, enjoined them to sustain the tempo.</p><p>The Bishop also expressed confidence in the ability of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct a free and fair election.</p><p>“The actors themselves will have to live with the consequences of the violence they trigger if it is established that particular actors were responsible for a particular outcome.</p><p>“We have been on this for a very long time. What do you do? How do you penalise actors who seem to be involved in instigating violence during elections?” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5BuZp6jmam2brPUm5yrZZWhsqTAyKilZqeeocZuwMeeZKWhpp67qHnCmqVmmpWjsqe102adq6edYrGmuc6cqZqbqWK4trfAoWSwmaKjwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./soludos-statment-on-obis-investments-sign-of-jealousy-malice-chukwumezie.html><span>←</span><span>Soludos Statment On Obis Investments Sign Of Jealousy, Malice Chukwumezie</span></a>
