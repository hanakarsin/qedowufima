It’s where the cast addresses all of the beef, fun and <a href=#>dangerous shade</a>, and has tearful moments.</p><p>Since its launch in 2009, <a href=#>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</a> has had explosive reunions (<a href=#>Caroline Manzo</a> and <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a>’s shade will forever be iconic). However, the cast’s <a href=#>13th and 14th seasons</a> might have been too much for its network to endure.</p><p>In June 2024, reports surfaced that, for the first time in its history, RHONJ wouldn’t have a traditional reunion. Unfortunately, viewers of the show aren’t that surprised it has come to this.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">‘The Real Housewives of New Jersey’ won’t have a Season 14 reunion, and there is reportedly “no path forward” for the cast.</h2><p>The Real Housewives of New Jersey cast has developed a reputation for tussling since Season 1 with Teresa Giudice’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">now legendary table flip</a>. But Seasons 13 and 14 were so brutal that Bravo canceled a sit-down RHONJ reunion to wrap up Season 14.</p><p>Throughout both seasons, <a href=#>Teresa and Melissa Gorga</a>’s ongoing feud caused a clear divide among their fellow cast members, Jennifer Aydin, <a href=#>Danielle Cabral</a>, <a href=#>Margaret Josephs</a>, Rachel Fuda, and friends of RHONJ, Jackie Goldschneider and Jennifer Fessler.</p><p>Following their fallout over Tre’s <a href=#>August 2022 wedding</a> and <a href=#>allegations made against one another</a>, she and Melissa refused to film any scenes together during the season. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> confirmed the sisters-in-law finally spoke at the Season 14 finale, which was teased at the end of the season premiere.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>The explosive event reportedly caused Bravo to shut down a traditional reunion that would have forced Teresa, Melissa, and the rest of the divided cast into the same room. According to a source reportedly close to the series, the finale will show how irretrievably broken the cast has become.</p><p>“A reunion is meant to have a resolution, and it's clear in the season final that there is no path forward in that type of setting," the source told People in June 2024. "So the network is figuring out a different concept to wrap up the season."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Is ‘The Real Housewives of New Jersey’ ending?</h2><p>Over the years, Bravo shows have become synonymous with reunions. For Housewives, specifically, it’s never a good sign when there’s not even a one-part special to wrap up the season.</p><p>The changes to the reunion have led fans to believe Season 14 could be the last of RHONJ as we know it.</p><p>In May 2024, <a href=#>Andy Cohen told Distractify</a> that RHONJ could be the next show in the Bravoverse to receive a cast shakeup. Andy said the cast is on “two very clear teams.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>In addition to Teresa and Melissa’s anchor feud, Tre’s beef with Margaret has also kept the drama going amongst the friend group. Season 14 also included Jennifer Fessler and Rachel’s short-lived drama and <a href=#>Danielle Cabral and Jennifer Aydin’s feud</a>, which reportedly escalated at the Season 14 finale.</p><p>As Teresa and Melissa remain at odds, reports have surfaced that Bravo would ultimately have to fire one of them (or both) to bring the show the peace it needs.</p><p>The Real Housewives of New Jersey airs on Bravo on Sundays at 8 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2asmJp6s7TOp6Fmq5WWwLC6jGprZqqVqruqu81mnp6sXZiur6%2FEpZyd</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./408059-manchester-city-ace-de-bruyne-rewarded-lucrative-new-deal-html.html><span>←</span><span>Manchester City Star De Bruyne Rewarded with Lucrative New Deal</span></a>
