The youngest of four children and the only boy, Tom was named after his father and shares a birthdate with his big sister Julie.</p><p>Just like his siblings, Tom followed in their steps and loved all things sports.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tom Brady (@tombrady)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Are the Bradys bad at any sports?</h2><p>Obviously Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time, but did you know he was also drafted by a <a href=#>Major League Baseball team</a>? That shouldn’t be surprising given his family's athleticism. One of the frequent things Tom shares about his siblings is that they’re better athletes than he is.</p><p>Maureen played college softball at Fresno State University and was an All-American pitcher.
