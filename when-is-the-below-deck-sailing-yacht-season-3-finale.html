Now, people are curious to know when the finale of Season 3 will be airing.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>Season 3 of <a href=#>Below Deck Sailing Yacht</a> has been filled with endless moments of drama and fun. All the crew members who have been working aboard Parsifal III have created deep connections and friendships with each other — though there is always drama along the way.</p><p>Though fans of the Below Deck franchise could watch the goings-on on board Parsifal III forever, the charter season is quickly coming to an end.</p><p>When is the Below Deck Sailing Yacht Season 3 finale? The final charter commenced on the June 13 episode, meaning that the end is in sight for Captain Glenn Shephard and his crew.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span><p>First Mate Gary King</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is the 'Below Deck Sailing Yacht' Season 3 finale?</h2><p><a href=#>Below Deck</a> is the original reality TV show that captivated audiences everywhere. The original series was so successful that it has since spurred three spin-off shows: Below Deck Mediterranean, Below Deck Sailing Yacht, and Below Deck Down Under (which airs on Peacock).</p><p>Below Deck Sailing Yacht is the only show in the franchise to feature a vessel that can sail. The first season, which debuted in 2020, consisted of 17 total episodes, while the sophomore season included 18 episodes.</p><p>The Season 3 finale of Below Deck Sailing Yacht, which will be the 17th episode of the season, will air on June 20, 2022. If there is a reunion special, then Season 3 will feature the same amount of episodes as Season 2.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will there be a Season 3 reunion for 'Below Deck Sailing Yacht'?</h2><p>Seasons 1 and 2 of Below Deck Sailing Yacht both got reunion episodes, which means Season 3 will likely also get the same treatment.</p><p>The reunion episode will give members of the Parsifal III crew a chance to discuss everything that happened during the charter season. They'll be able to sit down with none other than Andy Cohen, who will ask them deep questions about everything that went down on the yacht.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>As of now, it's unclear whether or not the reunion would be hosted in-person, or virtually. The reunions for the first two seasons were virtual, as many of the crew members were working on other boats around the world.</p><p>The reunion of <a href=#>Selling Sunset</a> Season 5 took place in person, allowing all the most famous real estate agents from the Los Angeles area to hash things out face-to-face –– minus <a href=#>Christine Quinn</a>, of course.</p><p>The reunion for <a href=#>Too Hot to Handle</a> Season 3, on the other hand, ended up being totally virtual with everyone discussing their time on the show via video chat.</p><p>Since reunion episodes for different reality shows are being hosted in both ways, it's unclear which direction Below Deck Sailing Yacht Season 3 will go when it comes time to make the reunion happen. What we do know is that there are going to be a lot of interesting topics to cover from crew members who’ve been spending a lot of time out on the water.</p><p>One of the biggest subjects that will undoubtedly be covered is <a href=#>Gary King</a>'s relationship status, along with all the drama that unfolded surrounding his love life.</p><p>If there is a reunion for Season 3, then it will likely air on June 27, 2022, which would be a full week after the finale debuts.</p><p>Below Deck Sailing Yacht airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo. You can also stream the series on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmuoyiqmasmJp6o7HLqK5mnJWYuG6%2FwKKjoqaXYsair8etZKydkai8r3mSZp2ippGhsg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./simon-williams-html.html><span>←</span><span>Simon Williams - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
