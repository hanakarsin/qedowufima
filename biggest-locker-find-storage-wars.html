The biggest find actually occurred off-camera while Dan was auctioneering an event. A buyer paid $500 for a storage unit that turned out to possess much more.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In 2018, Dotson explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Blast</a>, "An older Asian woman at the table next to me kept looking at me like she wanted to tell me something.”</p><p>"Eventually she walked up and told me her husband works with a guy who bought a unit from me for $500 and found a safe inside.”</p><p>After the man hired a locksmith to break the safe open, they discovered a whopping $7.5 million cash inside the safe.</p><p>Shortly after the find, the new owner received a phone call from the attorney of the former owner of the storage unit. At first, the woman was offered $600,000 to have the money returned, but the offer was later doubled to $1.2 million.</p><p>The new owner accepted the offer and returned the storage unit (including the cash) to the original owner.</p><p>On the ordeal, Dan's co-star <a href=#>Rene Nezhoda</a>, the owner of Bargain Hunters Thrift Store, commented, "If you find money like that, there's probably a reason it isn't in the bank."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dave bought a storage unit on 'Storage Wars' full of newspapers from a special date.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When <a href=#>Dave Hester</a> bought a storage unit for just $600, he wasn't expecting to find stacks and stacks of old newspapers. But there was a commonality binding this collection of newspapers together. They were all published on the same date: Aug. 16, 1977, <a href=#>the day Elvis died</a>.</p><p>“This could be big,” Dave said at the time. "This is something that’s going to add up to hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars or even tens of thousands of dollars.”</p><p>As it turns out, after Dave started to sell the newspapers for $12 each, he eventually made around $75,000 off the newspaper stash. That's obviously quite a bit less than $7.5 million, but nothing to scoff at!</p><p>Here's hoping someone on Storage Wars has an even bigger find than the $7.5 million someday ... and that the cameras are actually rolling when they do!</p><p>Storage Wars airs Tuesday nights at 10 p.m. on A&E.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7aos8Ssq2akn5i4pr6Mn6CnnF2owbC%2BwKCcZq%2BRp8A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tackle-iswap-activities-before-it-is-too-late-ortom-tells-buhari.html><span>←</span><span>Tackle ISWAP Activities Before It Is Too Late</span></a>
