Their sudden emergence has absolutely nothing to do with the Niger Delta struggle but rather a tool by certain elements to destabilise the current government. Going by their actions and subsequent statements, it has become very apparent on who the sponsors of these group are.</i></p><p><i>“MEND serves notice to the International Community that the Niger Delta region shall NOT be part of a secessionist Biafran State. Rather, the group believes in one strong united Nigerian federation where the principles and ideals of Resource Control; True Federalism; Rule of Law/Respect for Human Rights; Democracy; Free Enterprise and a Vibrant Civil Society are well entrenched in the grundnorm and put to practice.</i></p><p><i>“However, The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) remains vehemently opposed to the fraudulent and unsustainable Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP) headed by Brigadier General Paul Boroh (rtd) which still runs on the corrupt bureaucratic and operational template of the past administration. We have always made it very clear that unless the root issues which gave birth to the agitations in the Niger Delta region are addressed, in the form of a sincere dialogue, this programme will only continue to remain a mere cesspool of corruption.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp; </strong>Give Buhari a chance - Ex-Mend members</p><p><i><i>“In order to create an enabling environment for dialogue on the Niger Delta question, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) urges President Muhammadu Buhari to release the Okah Brothers - Henry and Charles who were arrested in 2010 on trumped-up charges. The release of Henry and Charles Okah will be key to any form of dialogue in helping to bring stability to the volatile region.”</i></i></p><p>The division among Niger Delta groups over the blowing up of pipelines as a way of communicating grievances to the federal government seems to be escalating.</p><p>A clash between two groups in the region over the control of the Tebidaba-Brass pipelines along the Azuzuama-Ikienghenbiri creek in Southern Ijaw local government, Bayelsa state resulted in fire.</p><p>While on of the groups claim to be safeguarding the region, others claim to be vandals leading to tension and shooting between the groups.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhXSDk21pZqaZnLKzecOeo62ZXZbDprrGnqmsZZakv66xw2apnqSRqbawutKhoKllkp6up77AZqSeppRjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./65981-html.html><span>←</span><span>Hashtag #BringBackOurGirls Hits 1 Million Tweets, Over 150k Instagram Posts</span></a>
