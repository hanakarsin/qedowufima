In the video, Marlee‚Äôs boyfriend is seen in the car on speakerphone, making an unexpectedly sweet call to Miss Vickie‚Äôs potato chip company.</p><p>The text over the video reads, "My boyfriend called the number on the back of these chips to tell them he loved them üò≠," making for a nice setup to the wholesome interaction.</p><p>The chips in question were Miss Vickie‚Äôs pickle chips from Subway. The conversation between Marlee‚Äôs boyfriend and a Miss Vickie‚Äôs customer service representative went sweetly:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @marleejwilson</span></figure><p>The rep starts by asking, "OK, and when did you purchase this bag?" Marlee‚Äôs boyfriend responds, "Um, about 10 minutes ago.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúSo you got it today?"</p><p>He confirms, "Yeah, yeah, I got it. I saw the number and I thought I might as well just give y'all a call just to let you know."</p><p>The rep, touched by his gesture, replies, "Well, that was really sweet of you."</p><p>The boyfriend then suggests, "I wanted to ask you for bigger bags."</p><p>The rep agrees, "That's exactly what I was thinking, a bigger bag would be awesome."</p><p>As the call wraps up, the rep says, "Those coupons will get to you in 10-15 business days ‚Ä¶ I hope you have a wonderful day and a great weekend coming up."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @marleejwilson</span></figure><p>The boyfriend responds warmly, "Thank you for that.

Another user pointed out the brighter side of customer service, "Honestly the lady probably deals with complaint calls all the time so these nice messages make her day ‚ù§Ô∏è."</p><p>So, who is this Miss Vickie everyone speculated about? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miss Vickie‚Äôs potato chips</a>, a beloved snack known for their crunch and natural ingredients, originated on a family farm in Ontario, Canada, in 1987. Created by Vickie and Bill Kerr, the recipe was inspired by Vickie's mother, who used old-school, traditional methods to cook the chips.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @marleejwilson</span></figure><p>The couple aimed to provide a healthier snack, free from artificial flavors and preservatives. Their dedication to quality gained popularity, leading to national distribution and eventual acquisition by Frito-Lay in 1993. Today, Miss Vickie‚Äôs remains a favorite for its clean taste and commitment to using simple, wholesome ingredients.</p><p>On this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon product page</a>, the glowing assessment of the chips is evident as well ‚Äî the brand enjoys a 4.5 out of 5 star rating on the popular online retailer across over 14,800 global reviews.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @marleejwilson</span></figure><p>Miss Vickie‚Äôs chips not only stand out for their quality but also for the customer service that leaves a lasting impression, as evidenced by Marlee‚Äôs viral video. Miss Vickie herself is no stranger to going viral‚Äì with her warm personality and charm in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recent video</a> that dropped.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @marleejwilson</span></figure><p>It's clear that both the product and the people behind it have a special place in many hearts. Way to go, Miss Vickie!
