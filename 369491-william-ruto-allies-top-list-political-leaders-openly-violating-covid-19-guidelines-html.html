William Ruto</h2><p class=align-left>The DP was recently captured on camera addressing farmworkers at his Sugoi home while neither wearing a mask nor observing social distance.</p><p class=align-left>None of the workers wore a mask as they freely interacted with Ruto who is supposed to be on the frontline in preaching the need to defeat a pandemic that has put the country on its knees.</p><p class=align-left>This has also been the norm at the DP’s Karen office in Nairobi where he has been often photographed flouting the rules during his many meetings with politicians, religious leaders and other groups.</p><h2>2. Johnson Sakaja</h2><p class=align-left>The Nairobi Senator hit headlines last weekend after he was arrested by the police for flouting Covid-19 rules.</p><p class=align-left>The then chairman of the Senate ad-hoc committee on COVID-19 was found drinking at Ladies Lounge along Dennis Pritt Road, Nairobi, in the dead of the night. But give it to Sakaja that he took full responsibility for his actions, apologising and further resigning from his chairmanship of the Senate committee.</p><h2>3. Oscar Sudi</h2><p class=align-left>The controversial Kapseret MP shocked many last weekend when he recklessly, yet dangerously, violated the health guidelines while addressing and mingling with mourners at a burial service in Kabenes, Uasin Gishu county.</p><p class=align-left>The vocal legislator, who has ironically never spoken in Parliament, shook hands with mourners who he engaged in conversations from a whispering distance, all the while not even donning a face mask.</p><p class=align-left>This has become the norm for Sudi, who recently handed over a car to a 100-year-old man while flouting all the health regulations; totally ignorant of the grave danger he was exposing the senior citizen to.</p><h2>4. Boni Khalwale</h2><p class=align-left>The former Kakamega senator has recently made headlines for all the wrong reasons as far as COVID-19 is concerned. He on Sunday, July 19, posted a picture of himself dishing out money to a woman who was allegedly preparing mandazi by the roadside.</p><p class=align-left>Neither of them had a mask on. Similar scenes were witnessed at a prayer service for jailed MP John Waluke where Khalwale, now a Tanga Tanga operative, was in attendance.</p><p class=align-left>The previous day, the so-called Bullfighter was part of an illegal political gathering at the home of Hamisi MP Charles Gimose.</p><p class=align-left>Khalwale, who did not have a mask on, was filmed engaging in a bitter altercation with police officers who went to stop the meeting, pouring water on one of them.</p><h2>5. Didmus Barasa</h2><p class=align-left>The Kimilili MP on Monday, July 20, shared pictures of him playing football with young boys and girls back in the village, all without masks and totally contravening COVID-19 guidelines. He appeared unperturbed by the peril he was exposing the children to at a time when Parliament has been rocked by a coronavirus crisis.</p><h2>6. Wycliffe Oparanya</h2><p class=align-left>The Council of Governors chairman is expected to lead by example given his critical role in combating the pandemic across the counties.</p><p class=align-left>But he has been repeatedly accused of flouting the COVID-19 rules by holding crowded meetings that also involve high-ranking government officials.</p><p class=align-left>He last weekend hosted hundreds of teachers from across Kakamega county, barely a week after he hosted officials of teachers’ unions in the region while in the company of Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa and other leaders.</p><h2>7. Musalia Mudavadi</h2><p class=align-left>Despite a ban on political gatherings, the ANC party leader and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang’ula have in recent days held a series of such meetings across Western Kenya, exposing the locals to the highly-contagious disease. MP Ayub Savula (ANC) was recently also arrested for flouting the COVID-19 rules.</p><h2>8. Aisha Jumwa</h2><p class=align-left>The Malindi MP over the weekend addressed a huge gathering of mourners in Furunzi area in her backyard, a gross violation of the COVID-19 regulations.</p><h2>9. Kipchumba Murkomen</h2><p class=align-left>The Elgeyo-Marakwet Senator recently found himself in the middle of a storm after he addressed a huge gathering of landslide victims in his county, all crowded together and none wearing a face mask.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a hot story or scandal you would like us to publish, please reach us through news@tuko.co.ke or WhatsApp: 0732482690 and Telegram: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tuko news</a></i></strong></p><p class=align-left><i><strong>Tuko news.
