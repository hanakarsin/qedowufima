So we want the government to listen to us. &nbsp;In fact we are giving the federal government 60 days ultimatum to listen to us or else we will shut down all the well heads in the area,” he threatened.</i></strong></p><p>He said that his group does not fear the army, should the government want to send it in, warning that when his group is ready to attack,<strong> “no amount of security” can stop them as they have the backing of “top people” in Nigeria and abroad.</strong></p><p>He warned that the cease fire and peace currently being enjoyed in Delta State was not the work of men of the Joint Task Force or of large numbers of security men parading the streets, but that <strong>his group had simply decided to give peace a chance by giving the State and Federal Government the benefit of the doubt </strong>and if after the 60 days ultimatum, nothing is done, they will do things that will shock the government.</p><p><strong>Several members of the community expressed their support of Kelvin and his dreaded gang.</strong> Chief Saroke Edah and two other women who spoke on behalf of the women described Kelvin as God-sent, and backed up his complaints that despite their feeding the nation with their God-given oil wealth for the past 50 years, their community lacks good infrastructure and schools, as well as empowerment for the youths and women.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXiBkGploaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./219917-man-released-by-uhuru-prison-steals-a-sheep-dramatic-html.html><span>←</span><span>Did Uhuru make a mistake releasing some of the 7k prisoners?</span></a>
