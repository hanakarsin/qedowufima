But, according to the New York <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Corrections and Community Supervision</a> (DOCCS), there are a few legal reasons why a former inmate might need to meet with their parole officer right away.</p><p>However, in every case, the former inmate has to meet with their parole officer within 24 hours of their release.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: WE tv</span></figure><p>The DOCCS says that if the inmate has outstanding warrants or even motor vehicle tickets, they have to report to their parole officer immediately to address that.</p><p>Even though it's not clear if this is the case for Troy, it is clear that his and Zeruiah's original plan has gone out the window. Not the car window, though, since we hope those were firmly closed during their "car chase."</p><p>Watch Love After Lockup on Fridays at 8 p.m. EST on WE tv.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqb%2BwxYypmKunnJp6sLLFopqeql2hvLexjJqdrZ2iYrmwr8qupw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-succession-improvised.html><span>←</span><span>The Brilliance of 'Succession' Improvisation Is All Thanks to EP Adam McKay</span></a>
