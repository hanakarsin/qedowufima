During the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone hopped onto <a href=#>Wordle</a> to generate a shared community out of guessing five-letter worlds while all of us were trapped inside. Before then, free-to-play titles like <a href=#>Flappy Bird</a> caught our eye. More recently, people were dropping fruits in the tetris-like <a href=#>Suika Game</a>.</p><p>As of 2024, a sandbox browser game called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Infinite Craft</a> became a new casual gaming hit. Developed by Neal Agarwal and released in mid-January 2024, this simple yet unique game allows players to combine various elements into new types for endless possibilities. The game achieved tens of thousands of users within its first month of release with people making all sorts of elements within it. In fact, people have even managed to make <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> in the game. Yeah, it goes that deep. Here's how.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Taylor Swift was wearing the yellow surprise song dress when she announced "The Black Dog" variant</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Players have apparently been able to make Taylor Swift in 'Infinite Craft'. Here's how.</h2><p>In Infinite Craft, players start out with the four basic elements — water, fire, wind, and earth. By clicking and dragging them from the sidebar and placing them on top of each other in the open space, you can combine them to make new elements. You may then continue putting elements on top of each other in various combinations to continuously generate new elements, resulting in a fascinating little gameplay loop where you strive to see what new element will pop up next in your collection.</p><p>These "elements" include everything from nature to objects to poems to even fictional characters. It can even create specific video games, philosophical concepts, religions, and real-life celebrities. And somehow, it can even generate all-powerful deities like Taylor Swift.</p><p>That's right, people have been able to work through Infinite Craft well enough for the game to come up with Tay-Tay for all you Swifties out there.</p><p>According to several players in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">r/Taylor Swift subreddit</a>, the two elements you'll need for sure are "American Princess" and "Heartbreak". Of course, you'll have to create those two elements to begin with.</p><p>Here are the steps you'll need to make the elements for Taylor Swift.
