For avoidance of doubt, on no account whatsoever did this house prior to the 4th of February, 2022, initiate or even intend to initiate impeachment proceedings against the deputy governor.</p><p>“However, sometime in 2021, in the month of July or thereabouts, the house officially invited the deputy governor under the provisions of section 128 and section 129 of the 1999 constitution (as amended).</p><p>“The deputy governor mischievously approached the federal high court in Abuja, alleging that the house is in the process of impeaching him. The court, in its wisdom, ordered maintenance of status quo by both parties on the matter. This gave the deputy governor the right to perform all functions of a deputy governor and not honour the invitation of the house. The house, as an institution of law and order, obeyed that court order.</p><p>“The allegations against the deputy governor are: abuse of office which include constitutional breach of sections 190 and 193, subsections 1 and 2, paragraphs a, b and c of the 1999 constitution (as amended); criminal self-enrichment using public funds; and failure to discharge constitutional duties, which gave rise to insubordination.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports the State Governor <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Bello Matawalle</a></strong> and his Deputy fell out in July 2021, after Matawalle defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) but Gusau remained in the PDP.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49xZrOZnZuus62Moaauq5VivKd5wKyqnqWSocZuuMisq6xlpJ2%2FprGMqJ2fnZ6YsrR5wKCYoqajqXqlsc%2Buq7Jll6TDpr7NqKlmm5%2Biuqa6wp6qZqGdpbKir8emnKesXaK8t7HSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./georgia-amoore-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Who Are Georgia Amoore's Parents?
