I only have an opportunity, and I just want to play and give my best.”</p><p>On Super Eagles’ struggle for goals, the goalkeeper added, “For me, the goals will come when you have someone like Victor Osimhen; for me, we are not worried about goals but about the three points. And now we have qualified. Monday’s win (over Guinea-Bissau) is a nice feeling for me and the team.”</p><p>Stanley Nwabali is expected to be between the sticks when the Super Eagles of Nigeria take on Cameroon in the 2023 AFCON round of 16 at 9 p.m. on Saturday, January 27.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FtZqyskaO5psWMp66ampGhtm61zaygrKyjYrWmecisZKenpGLAtrzEq2SemZehsrR5xaKprKxdmLWwtcKeZKCnkaG4prHPnqlo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jaya-bachchan-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jaya Bachchan - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
