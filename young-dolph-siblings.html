His seventh album, "Rich Slave," dropped in 2020 and debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 chart.</p><p>Born in Chicago, Dolph moved to Memphis, Tenn. when he was only 2 years old along with his four siblings ‚Äî two brothers and two sisters. They were primarily raised by their grandmother, as his parents had developed drug addictions.</p><p>Dolph said that his grandmother was "the meanest motherf--ker in the world" to him and his siblings in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Revolt</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He went on to say, "I didn't get that s--t at the time. ... All the s--t she was telling you, you get to seeing that s--t when you hit about 15." Dolph stated that it was around that time he began to implement her own teachings in his life to better himself and become an independent young man.</p><p>Dolph's grandmother would usually prohibit the children from having friends over but would often allow other kids who were homeless to stay with them. In the same interview, the late rapper stated that it was very common for many of his peers to be raised by their grandmothers, as many folks his parents' age battled drug addiction in his South Memphis neighborhood.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Dolph was also the oldest brother of his siblings, so he took it upon himself to become "self-sufficient" as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a> reported. "We were in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades, seeing this living hell," he told the outlet.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>On the scene of a shooting on Airways.
