He instead went for Ngannou who he argued wouldn’t be an easy fight for him as his critics are suggesting.</p><p>Some boxing enthusiasts still believe that a victory over Francis Ngannou can give Anthony Joshua a shot at the world title.</p><p>“Let me say this again, I’m not focusing on that,” Joshua said on The MMA Hour.</p><p>“I’m going to take my mind, I have to draw it back that Ngannou is my undisputed title fight. That’s the mentality I have to have.</p><p>“Ngannou is my undisputed fight. Because you’re only as good as your last fight, and I respect him a lot. He ain’t easy money. He’s a hard night’s work. And you know what’s crazy? So am I. I’m a hard night’s work for anyone.
