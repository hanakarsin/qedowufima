As the title says, the series offers viewers plenty of secret rendezvous full of humor and, let's say, passion.</p><p>We don't know about you, but with a Season 2 on its way, we can't wait to see what will happen with our favorite girls. Hopefully, they can move on from their <a href=#>first semester mistakes</a> and make room for even more wild blunders!</p><p>Season 1 is now streaming in its entirety on HBO Max.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Made for Love'</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Based on the 2017 novel of the same name, the HBO Max original series Made for Love met widespread acclaim when it premiered on the streaming giant in April 2021.</p><p>The show, deemed a dark comedy (emphasis on the dark, please), follows Hazel Green-Gogol (<a href=#>Cristin Milioti</a>), a woman who escapes a toxic marriage to tech billionaire Byron (Billy Magnussen).</p><p>After she thinks she's finally free, Hazel learns that Byron planted a tracking device into her brain. Thus, he has the power to track her location, watch her live, and analyze her "emotional data."</p><p>Season 1 is now streaming on HBO Max, but don't fret — Season 2 is on its way and will most likely drop sometime in late 2022.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Hacks'</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>We honestly think Hacks is an underrated gem on HBO Max. Currently recording a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">100-percent rating</a> on Rotten Tomatoes, the dramedy took home three Primetime Emmy Awards in 2021:</p><ul><li>Outstanding Lead Actress for <a href=#>Jean Smart</a></li><li>Outstanding Directing for Lucia Aniello</li><li>Outstanding Writing for Lucia Aniello, Paul W. Downs, and Jen Statsky</li></ul><p>The streaming series centers on the relationship between a legendary Las Vegas stand-up comedian and a Gen-Z comedy writer.

The miniseries fits oh so perfectly into our current world since it takes place two decades after a flu pandemic wipes out civilization.</p><p>The miniseries features a group of survivors that get by on being traveling performers. However, the pack eventually runs into a violent cult, and the leader seems to have a link to one of the entertainers.</p><p>Critics and viewers alike having been <a href=#>loving the slow burn aspect</a> of the show, and have praised it for its positive outlook on a global pandemic.</p><p>There are currently five episodes available to stream on HBO Max.
