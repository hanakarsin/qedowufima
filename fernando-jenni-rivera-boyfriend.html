"We grew up in LA listening to banda music, and no one is bringing it out in a new way, but I want to change that. I'm going to write in a bilingual way, but still have traditional elements. I am going to do it. I hope they like my music."</p><p>Fernie's latest track, "When I Dream About You," was released in the summer of 2020, and we're excited to hear more.</p><p>Follow Fernando on Instagram at @fernieofficialig, and stream La Mariposa de Barrio on Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7KzusCnm6hlmpq7r7WMq6CvnaKWeqO72J%2Bpop2emQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./biggest-locker-find-storage-wars.html><span>←</span><span>What Was the Biggest Locker Find on Storage Wars?</span></a>
