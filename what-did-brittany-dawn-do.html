However, the influencer, who married her husband Jordan in 2021, stands accused of some pretty stomach churning business practices, which have ultimately lead to an impending trial.</p><p>According to multiple <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sources</a>, the trial has been delayed indefinitely, although it was set to start on March 6, 2023. The charges stem back to Brittany Dawn's failed company, Brittany Dawn Fitness, which purportedly sold $1.3 million worth of, well, nothing, back in 2014.</p><p>The Texas foster mom, who is now the target of frequent online backlash, allegedly sold customers customized fitness plans for as much as $300 but never provided what she claimed their money would buy.
