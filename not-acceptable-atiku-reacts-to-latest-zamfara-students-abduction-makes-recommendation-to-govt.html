For a region that’s playing catch-up in the critical area of education, this continued assault on the bedrock of our development is not acceptable,” he wrote.</p><p>He also recommended the government sets up a special protection unit charged with the safety of the schools and the school children alone to forestall such attacks in the future.</p><p>“Perhaps the time has come to have a School Protection Standby Unit deployed exclusively to protect schools in areas prone to these attacks. If we don’t take preemptive actions, I fear that education in the already disadvantaged regions may suffer irreversible losses.”</p><p>“Meanwhile, I hope that no effort will be spared for a speedy recovery of the students,” he added.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Governor Bello Matawalle-led Zamfara State Government has <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew</a></strong> in all 14 local government areas in the state.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that the Zamfara government also closed schools, both private and public, operating in all the local governments in the state.</p><p>The curfew is from eight o’clock in the evening to seven o’clock in the morning.</p><p>“The move, according to authorities, is to control the rising cases of banditry and kidnapping in the state,” it said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e49rZqenpGKupK%2FEqauampyaeqLAyKSsZqqVlrC1v4ytpmakkamytMCMs5imnpGnrm6%2F066bnqakqHqirsOumq2hn6N6rq3KnqpmqpWYvK65xKebmqyZpLtuwM5mnqiupGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./389083-what-happened-michael-richards-seinfeld-html.html><span>←</span><span>What happened to Michael Richards from Seinfeld?</span></a>
