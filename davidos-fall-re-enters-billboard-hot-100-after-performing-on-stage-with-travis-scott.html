Re-entering the Billboard Afrobeats song Charts after five years of release shows the longevity of the track which makes Davido’s style of music more and more reckoned with.</p><p>His performance on stage last Saturday was dimmed ‘electrifying’ and for a song that is five years old, it seems as though ‘Fall’ may never fall.</p><p>‘Fall’ was released in 2017 in almost the same period as ‘IF,’ ‘FIA’ and ‘Like Dat’ and of the four, ‘Fall’ flew the farthest, breaking musical boundaries and going as far as getting high international recognition. Certified Gold in the U.S after selling over 500,000 units, ‘Fall’s’ success in the U.S was more than spectacular.</p><p>The hit track also saw huge success in the U.K and Europe as well. Its re-entry into the charts further proves its popularity.</p><p>Performing at one of America’s biggest rap stars show spread the song like wildfire and it’ll be quite interesting to see if the numbers will begin to increase again. ‘500,000 unit sales and counting’ may be only a matter of time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5BpZp2Zpp6xsL%2BMn5ilpF2nsm6xza2cq6tdl7atuMGomKucXZ28tXmQaWdmmZapsrN5z56pn6eioravs4yopWarpJa0pnnWoquhZaSnrre10maqnKekqXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./portable-fumes-at-concertgoers-for-not-spraying-him-money-during-performance-in-germany.html><span>←</span><span>Portable Fumes At Concertgoers For Not Spraying Him Money During Performance In Germany</span></a>
