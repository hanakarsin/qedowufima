After Christmas time. Late January to third week of February. You will see that they are getting full. Unusually. I’m into the business of data and statistics. And I decided to particularly look at that. This tells you that social media is going to vote. Even if they are in Antarctica, one person is there and he mobilises 100,000 people here to go out and vote. It has succeeded.</p><p>“We are not scared. The bank balance of any big politician is starting to be irrelevant. Those of us who sweated for the little that we have, we are spending it very wisely and carefully. Those of them who made it from government, who will just open the coffers and bring it out; they will continue to splash it and it will continue to mean less and less.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e49yZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm7Ax55km5meoHqjrcuapZydXaSzbq3NsmSboZdivbC4yK2gnKGRo3q4u82tZKaZpKmys3nSqJqimZxiuqawyJpksKGcoXq3u9OeZJ2ZpKm2bq7Am5hmmZiisqV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./402625-woman-tells-men-stop-using-moms-names-give-girlfriends-false-hope-html.html><span>←</span><span>Woman tells men to stop using their moms' names to give girlfriends false hope</span></a>
