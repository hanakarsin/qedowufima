I think there was something I read about somebody speculating about whatever investment. With what I’ve seen today, the value of those investments is worth next to nothing. So, let’s leave that aside.”</p><p class=p1>Reacting to the statement, Nze Kanayo Chukwumezie, while speaking with Journalists on Friday in Awka, stressed that Soludo may have an hidden agenda, hence the unruly and unprofessional statement.</p><p class=p1>He said: “The statement is very unruly, unprofessional and seems like he is either jealous of Obi’s exploits or that he has malice. It carries much undercurrent that will soon manifest itself.</p><p class=p1>“Soludo may be having a hidden agenda. It is a shocker and no one expects such from him, especially being the governor of Obi’s state, considering Obi’s acceptance across all ethnic groups, states, gender, age brackets and even political divides. Soludo has many explanations to make.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BqZqynnKqxsL%2BMrKuarJ2au7V5zqdkqJqZqHqqutWeqq2llaPBtHnSop6nZZ%2BbequxwKWmrqupYrqiuMicnGabmKq4uMHMnrGinV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-this-last-season-queen-of-the-south.html><span>←</span><span>Season 5 Will Be the Last for 'Queen of the South'</span></a>
