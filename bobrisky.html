The question is, why single out Mr. Olarewaju? In prosecuting offences like this, security agencies must be careful not to give the impression that the defendant is being targeted for alleged offences other than those stated on the face of the charge.</p><p>“We urge our security agencies to adopt a community service approach for victimless crimes like Naira Mutilation, while we reaffirm our commitment to the rule of law and the protection of human rights at all times.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZqJqinsCsxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-are-fencers-attached-to-a-cable.html><span>←</span><span>Why Are Fencers Attached to a Cable?
