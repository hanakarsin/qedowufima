He however observed that the challenges the country had been facing was that of leadership which never did the required things to reduce corrupt practices in the land.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Buhari Advised To Extend Anti-Corruption War To Ex-Leaders</p><p>The president explained this during an interview he had on the Hausa service of the BBC on Thursday, December 24, stating that after his administration blocks all loopholes for siphoning the nation's wealth, there will be sufficient money to run the affairs of the country regardless of low oil price.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>SHOCKING: Indian Hemp Hidden Among Biscuit Cartons</p><p>The president who spoke extensively said:</p><p><i>“Remember dur­ing the campaigns, we said Ni­geria is facing three things and nobody disputed that assertion. Firstly; there was widespread insecurity, war in the North- East, while the country’s oil was being stolen at random in the South. Secondly, there is mas­sive unemployment, 62 per cent of the nation’s population are youth from the age of 35 years downward; most of them are un­employed, including those who went to school and those who did not, that is a serious problem.</i></p><p><i>“Therefore, it has become necessary to restore peace and create employment. That is why we are returning to agriculture and mineral resources. Thirdly, bribery and corruption are basi­cally suffocating the country. If we don’t kill these monsters, this country would go down.</i></p><p><i>“That is why those who stole monies meant for arms pro­curement and shared the fund among themselves are being arrested and are being shown documents, so that they would be asked to refund the money or face prosecution; we would use those documents to prove what they stole, collect all the assets acquired from the proceeds and then jail them.”</i></p><p>Buhari who lamented the fact that his government inherited over two trillion naira debt from the previous administration stated further that:</p><p><i>“It is generally believed that a fish begins to rot from the head; once the head is rotten, the whole body is also rotten. We have tried to remove all the heads of the organisations, and most of the lieutenants have been changed.</i></p><p><i>“A lot is happening in this government that people do not appear to understand; many per­manent secretaries of ministries have been changed; we used to have 42 ministers, now we have 36 because the Constitution re­quires that each state of the fed­eration must have a minister; we used to have 42 ministries, now we have 24.</i></p><p><i>“Everybody knows Nigeria is not a poor country, we are rich, and we have human resources, the problem had been that lead­ership did not take seriously, curbing corrupt tendencies,” he said.</i></p><p><i>“At the local government level, almost everyone knows each other. It would be easy to identify those to give who would go into trading and how to get it back. It would be like a cooperative and we all know how it operates.</i></p><p><i>“Also, state governments would identify those who have capacity to employ more people and all we need to do is to em­power them. Our people already know how to go about imple­menting these modalities to create employment for the citi­zens.”</i></p><p>The efforts of the Buhari-led administration to fight corruption in all facets received another boost when the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) clamped down on drug traffickers who drove a truck full of</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3iFkmtoZpyRqMKstYyaqaarXaiworrDmqNmm5%2Bjw6qv06xksKGcoXqtu9KeZKmqn6Wys8DInqpmn5%2BrsrO6zJ6lrWWSqrWivshnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-why-we-rejected-peter-obi-dogara-northern-christian-leaders-reveal.html><span>←</span><span>2023: Why We Rejected Peter Obi</span></a>
