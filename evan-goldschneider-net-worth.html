Many are craving something different as old feuds continue to feed new feuds. The battle of <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a> versus everyone else is still very much alive and well, but now Teresa has one person on her side: <a href=#>Jackie Goldschneider</a>. Jackie, who was a full-time Housewife in Seasons 9 through 12, is currently in a friend role, and it appears that her new chosen friend is Teresa.</p><p>Jackie and Teresa have an interesting yet complicated past. Teresa, during an event in Jackie's debut season, began spreading a rumor that Jackie's husband, <a href=#>Evan Goldscheider</a>, was sleeping with other women. This led to a feud big enough for Teresa to swear never to speak to her again. The rumor also led to some difficulties in Jackie and Evan's marriage, but they got through it just fine without having to enact Jackie's prenup. Jackie comes from money, but what's Evan Goldschneider's net worth?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Evan Goldschneider's net worth?</h2><p>Looking at his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn page</a>, one can tell that Evan is a <a href=#>very busy</a> man. He has his own business, works high up for another, and even teaches as an adjunct professor at Georgetown. Because of his very diverse portfolio, Evan has earned a substantial amount of wealth in his career. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Life & Style</a>, Evan's net worth is $7 million dollars, which is certainly a comfortable amount. Between his businesses and professorial gig, it seems as if Evan has no plans to slow things down any time soon.</p><p class="sc-ktvXtq dPyThM"><span>Evan Goldschneider</span></p><p class="sc-fxFQrc gpgOkp">Businessman, Professor, Entrepreneur</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $7 million</p><p>Evan Goldschneider is a businessman and entrepreneur who wears multiple hats. He is currently an adjunct professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. He is married to TV personality and The Real Housewives of New Jersey star Jackie Goldschneider.</p><p><strong>Birthdate:</strong> Aug. 8, 1974</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> New York City, N.Y.</p><p><strong>Marriage: </strong>Jackie Goldschneider (2006–present)</p><p><strong>Children: </strong>Two sets of twins named<strong> </strong>Jonas & Adin Goldschneider, and Hudson & Alexis Goldschneider</p><p><strong>Education: </strong>University of Michigan</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What does Evan Goldschneider do in his many jobs?</h2><p>Evan has been in business and finance his entire adult career. He is currently the managing director at MWC Group, which specializes in global financing. He's also the co-founder of The Distinction Group, which is an investor advising group. And he is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, where he is currently teaching a course on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hedge fund</a> investing. Having three jobs in addition to being <a href=#>a father</a> and husband is pretty impressive.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Teresa's slanderous comments about Evan and Jackie's marriage are all water under the bridge.</h2><p>Many are suspicious of Jackie's friendship with Teresa, and with good reason. Teresa had no cause to spread rumors about Evan <a href=#>allegedly cheating</a> on Jackie, so even though they squashed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their feud</a> after the fact, it's still odd. After all, who would want to be friends with someone who almost destroyed their marriage? Many, including <a href=#>Melissa Gorga</a>, think that Jackie is simply using Teresa for more screen time. Jackie, however, says her intentions <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">are genuine</a> and that their friendship is very real.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmsOiuoygpqWco5i1r7HInZyrZZ6awW7DzquroQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./256239-matiangis-motorcade-stoned-by-rowdy-youths-kawangware-html.html><span>←</span><span>Matiang'i's motorcade stoned by rowdy youths in Kawangware</span></a>
