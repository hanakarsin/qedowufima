It is catering to all of our young people. Young Nigerians are gifted in different areas. This is not only for those who want to be doctors, lawyers, and accountants. It is also for those who aspire to use their skilled and trained hands to build our nation. In accordance with this, I have instructed NELFUND to explore all opportunities to inculcate skill-development programmes because not everybody wants to go through a full university education,” he said.</p><p>President Tinubu emphasized the need for equity and inclusivity in the management of the programme.</p><p>He said: “No matter how economically challenged you are, accredited and qualified students will and must have access to this loan to advance their education in higher institutions. There is no compromise in our commitment to the disadvantaged citizens of this nation.”</p><p>In his presentation to the President, Sawyerr said the loan application process will be technology-driven, limiting human interface and “eliminating any possibility of maladministration in the programme.”</p><p>He said: “By design, this is a perpetual programme and will not terminate. The funds, earmarked for bona-fide Nigerian students, will be disbursed directly to the institutions in the initial phase through electronic transfer. Our students will be catered to in a way that bypasses human interference through the full utilization of available technological platforms, in adherence to Your Excellency’s stated objectives.”</p><p>He also said NELFUND has developed a robust risk-mitigation mechanism to address potential risks that may arise from the programme.</p><p>Speaking on the funding mechanism of the programme, Dr. Zacch Adedeji, Executive Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), said funding sources have been made available to ensure the smooth take-off and sustenance of the programme.</p><p>“Mr. President is permanently solving the problem of funding for education in Nigeria. By the directive of the President, the Education Tax Fund is being reviewed to additionally cater to the needs of our university students across all local government areas in the country as they seek to access vocational and traditional university education. Funding for the programme will be adequately covered,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FrZq2hnqqvtnnDoqmem6SoeqbEz5qlrKGfo3qwsoysq66claPBbrjOmqVmq5Odsq6xjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./microguardian-html.html><span>←</span><span>MicroGuardian - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
