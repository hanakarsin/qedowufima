Itching underneath the unhygienic plaster cast can cause sores and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even lead to infection</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This wouldn't be an issue with Cast21 as it's far more breathable and hygienic.&nbsp;</p><p>Veronica Hogg, Cast21's vice president of engineering, told the Daily Mail:&nbsp;"We have this radical notion that you can enjoy your healing experience. You don't need to be restrained from daily activities."</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, fitting a cast could take as little as ten minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>First, a doctor or nurse would measure the limb. Once they've selected the right sized cast, they put it on the limb and fill it with a mix of resins. After the sleeve is full, it only takes about three minutes for the cast to become malleable.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>A breathable design and comfortable fit that will have both you and your doctor smiling! üòÅüòÅ #cantholdmeback</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>CAST21</a> (@cast21official) on Mar 4, 2019 at 3:13pm PST</p></figure><p>Doctors can then mold the cast to fit the patient's limb, and then wait another five minutes for the resin to harden fully.&nbsp;</p><p>It's also far easier to remove than traditional casts, which requires doctors to use a circular saw.&nbsp;</p><p>Hogg added:&nbsp;"The majority of fractures happen in children, adolescents and the elderly."</p><p>"Those saws are very loud and all this debris flies off and it's very messy, it can be extremely frightening. The cast saw also presents a risk of burns to the patient."</p><p>"Our product does not require that at all. It's designed so that a physician can take clinical shears, snip through the tabs and pull it open easily."</p><p>"It was designed to completely eliminate the use of a cast saw and make the healing process far more pleasant for the patient."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Hey Instagram!

"It reaches about the same temperature as a hot tub."</p><p>"Another bonus is that no electricity or water is needed to apply our cast, so it's very portable."</p><p>"It has potential for use in the military and for at-home first aid."</p><p>"I'm from Colorado and I like to go hiking, the equipment needed to administer our cast is so small and lightweight that hikers and climbers could carry it with them in their backpacks."</p><p>The cast is still a ways off, with the company only designing a forearm model in a medium size. They hope to be able to create casts for legs as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Hogg added: "The idea is to prove that this technology works right now, we are past the prototype stage and have a fully functioning model in place for the forearm."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>A custom fit every time ensures maximum comfort üôå</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>CAST21</a> (@cast21official) on Oct 4, 2018 at 4:02pm PDT</p></figure><p>"We hope this technology can span across the entire body.
