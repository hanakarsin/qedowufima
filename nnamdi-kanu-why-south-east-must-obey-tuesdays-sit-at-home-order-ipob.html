No fewer than 28 innocent Biafrans were killed that day by the Nigeria Army during the raid.</p><p>“We advise all Biafrans, both men and women, to stay indoors tomorrow as a mark of honour to these fallen heroes and heroines. We must not fail to remember the supreme sacrifices of these great freedom seekers. Nothing done to honour them should be considered too much for they have watered the tree of Biafra freedom with their blood.</p><p>“Our Leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has also made a lot of sacrifices for the restoration of Biafra. So, all of us must be prepared to play our roles to accomplish this great task. Biafra independence is a mandate that we must live to accomplish.”</p><p>“We won’t be deterred by the killings of Biafra agitators by Nigeria compromised security agencies who cannot confront Fulani bandits and herdsmen rampaging the country. They derive pleasure in killing and torturing innocent people agitating for their freedom while fleeing from real terrorists,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BsZqemkaKxqnnKmqWuZaedxm6%2Fzq6roWWVlsC1ecyuqq1ln5eyunnTrpysnJGuwG6%2FyK1kmqxdnbyusYyoqZ2domK2sbvBaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-i-featured-in-brotherhood-movie-basketmouth.html><span>←</span><span>Why I Featured In Brotherhood Movie Basketmouth</span></a>
