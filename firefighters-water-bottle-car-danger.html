The alarms are charged, and you've got your exit route planned and labeled. Seems like you've done all you can in terms of fire safety. OR HAVE YOU?</p><p>It turns out there are still more ways to start a fire that you've probably never even considered, and this new way involves one of fire's only natural enemies: water.</p><p>This video of a hunky battery technician from the Idaho Power Company named Dioni Amuchastegui is gaining traction again as summer temperatures threaten vehicles. Amuchastegui was walking by a truck on his break when he noticed a little smoke inside a parked van, WYFF 4 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>. And you know what they say—where there's smoke, there's fire.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Amuchastegui did a helpful dramatic reenactment in a Facebook video for the power company, in an effort to warn people that the water bottles they leave in their cars on hot days pose a potential danger to their belongings.</p><p>The water bottle acts sort of like a magnifying glass, refracting and focusing the light. If you're a little psycho who burned up ants in the driveway as a kid, you know exactly how powerful a focused beam of sunlight can be. If you weren't, you had that classmate, and avoided them.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>What's especially scary about it is that the bottle was just casually tossed on the seat. You don't have to be a mad genius engineer to start a fire in a car, MacGyver-style. Amuchastegui showed how the bottle looked when he saw it smoking out the van:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>And the very real burn marks that were starting on the seat:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>You can see his entire process in the short video:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>What's funny about this potentially devastating occurrence is that it's been a rumor for a long time that water bottles could start car fires, but the rumor had been dismissed as an urban legend.</p><p>The Midwest City Fire Department tried to prove it to everyone with a test, igniting a fire using a water bottle that went up to 250 degrees, KFOR <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> at the time.</p><p>“The sunlight will come through, when it’s filled with liquid, and act as a magnifying glass as you would with regular optics,” said Firefighter David Richardson.</p><p>“It uses the liquid and the clear material to develop a focused beam and sure enough, it can actually cause a fire, a combustion."</p><p>But there was also a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> from Hoaxslayer in 2008, in which they experimented with a variety of bottle shapes and sizes to see what the likelihood of water starting a fire really was. In their determination, they tried a number of different bottles and discovered it was indeed possible with any clear bottle in the right lighting conditions.</p><p>So, what to do? Well, you could throw your bottle under the seat, cover it up so the light won't hit it, or carry it with you. Or buy a dark reusable container if you don't trust yourself to do any of those things.</p><p>Though I like this survivalist angle:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Can a Plastic Water Bottle Left in a Hot Car Cause a Fire?<br>Friends, for those of us that live in hot or desert climates, this is a worthwhile warning.

You may someday want to start a fire with a water bottle.</p><p>But most people are seeing the negative, because we all prefer to live in terror:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Except this guy.
