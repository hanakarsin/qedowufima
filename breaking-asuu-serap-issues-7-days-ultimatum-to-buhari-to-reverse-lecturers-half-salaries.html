Days after calling off the strike, President Buhari’s government only paid lecturers for 18 working days in the month of October.</p><p>The development has since generated concerns among stakeholders. Explaining why it paid the lectures half-salary, the incumbent government in a statement on Saturday through the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment noted that members of ASUU were paid their October salary pro-rata.</p><p>According to the ministry, pro-rata was done because <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>they cannot be paid for work not done</strong></a>, adding that the Minister of Labour and Employment, <strong>Chris Ngige,</strong> never directed the Accountant General of the Federation to pay the university lecturers half salaries.</p><p>Reacting, however, to the government’s stand, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>SERAP</strong></a> in a terse statement on its social media on Sunday, said it has ordered the president to within the next seven days, reverse the illegal deduction of the lecturer’s salary.</p><p>The statement read: “We’ve asked President Buhari to reverse within 7 days the apparently illegal deductions from the salaries of ASUU members or face legal action. Paying lecturers half salaries for going on strike is unlawful, and a deliberate attempt to make ASUU a lame duck.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49vZpuqlZa4qrrGZpisraViwKa%2BwKlkoqujqrK0eZZmm5qxo2LCrcDIppitrZ1iwbB5wa6fmqqZYsGwedGerZ6qo5p6rbHCrayrnaKoeqmty59krJmclr%2BqsdJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./291025-semi-16-zinazoonyesha-kwamba-unamchumbia-jamaa-mhanyaji-html.html><span>←</span><span>Semi 16 zinazoonyesha kwamba unamchumbia jamaa mhanyaji</span></a>
