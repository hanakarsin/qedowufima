Osimhen who is just 24-year-old has been fantastic for Napoli especially last season in which he scored 26 goals and provided 5 assists in 32 league games.
This performance did not only help Napoli to win the Scudetto for the first time in 33 years, it also earned him the league top scorer award and the best Serie A striker of the season award."><meta name=author content="Enda Jantzen"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He was the first to arrive for training sessions and the last to leave. He is an incredible leader. He feels the competition also during training sessions. When he won a penalty shootout he celebrated with his ‘Siuu’ like in the Champions League. Osimhen is a leader, he always wants to win and drag the team,” The French tactician told DAZN.</p><p>“He’s a bit like Cristiano Ronaldo. When he wins, he is super happy. He calls his teammates to take pictures and I like him. He is one of the best in the world, he could only attack, but he also helps the team defensively, he presses opponents and it’s so good for the team. This is part of the group’s qualities.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5BxZqeZoKS5qnnCqJicoF2YvK68wKucrGWfqLautMSnZK2nXZi%2Fqr%2FTopinp12nvK%2Bty52maA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./more-troubles-for-hushpuppi-as-he-is-denied-bail-in-the-us.html><span>←</span><span>More Troubles For Hushpuppi As He Is Denied Bail In The US</span></a>
