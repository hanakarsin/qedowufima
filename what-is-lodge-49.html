Why should you be watching? Here's what you need to know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Lodge 49? It's a quirky modern-day fable.</h2><p>According to its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official show page bio</a>, Lodge 49 "is a light-hearted, endearing modern fable set in Long Beach, Calif."&nbsp;</p><p>Wyatt Russell (whose parents are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldie Hawn</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kurt Russell</a>) plays Dud, the ex-surfer you can't help but like. Dud's father recently passed away and the family business has fallen apart, but a rundown lodge is filled with characters who present a promising future.&nbsp;</p><p>Ernie (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brent Jennings</a>) is the "Luminous Night" of Lodge 49. He welcomes Dud to the fray, but Dud's sister Liz Dudley (played by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sonya Cassidy</a>) has her reservations.&nbsp;</p><p>The beer is cheap, the people are funny, and Dud is fully caught up in the hope of returning to his once idyllic life.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: AMC/YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Where is Lodge 49 filmed?&nbsp;</h2><p>So Lodge 49 is set in Long Beach, Calif., but most of the show is actually filmed in and around Atlanta, Ga.&nbsp;</p><p>"Atlanta would not come to mind at first because [Lodge 49] is about Long Beach," executive producer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Freilich</a> said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgia FMDI</a>. "The problem with shooting in Los Angeles for us on the budget we had is that it was cost-prohibitive..."&nbsp;</p><p>"But because of the Georgia incentive, we're able to afford a show that would normally cost a million or $2 million more per episode if it were shot almost anywhere else," he continued.&nbsp;</p><p>"There's no question the money that we're offered to bring work to Georgia is one of the big drawing cards... that you can go there and actually put together a group that's at least as skilled as any other city that I've ever worked in the world makes it a pleasure."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Georgia FMDE/YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What are critics saying about Lodge 49?</h2><p>Season 1 of Lodge 49 has a "certified fresh" rating of 86 percent on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">critics' consensus</a> reads, "Lodge 49 takes a surreal journey into the television dreamscape that can prove quite rewarding for viewers who stick with it."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>In praise of <a href=#>#Lodge49</a>, a show in which precious little seems to happen, but in a meaningful, intoxicating way: <a href=#>https://t.co/GCGh8EHxTE</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/6zDQlG0zMe</a></p>— Alan Sepinwall (@sepinwall) <a href=#>August 9, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What can audiences expect to see in Season 2 of Lodge 49?</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Lodge 49 creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim Gavin</a> said, "I think we will be digging into the history of the Lodge itself, and as it relates to the history of Long Beach, and [the city's] aerospace past. How those communities were built around what was once an engine of prosperity — and it’s now an empty space in the center of town."</p><p>He continued: "We will continue to tell that story, always with an eye on the fringe places: your strip malls, your service-job community, the highways and byways of industrial plumbing sales. All the things that viewers are clamoring for in this television environment."</p><p>Catch the Season 2 premiere of Lodge 49 on August 12 at 10 p.m. on AMC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmakn5m0pnmTcg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./276999-ebola-nurse-dies-lagos-html.html><span>←</span><span>Second Nurse Passes Away This Morning - Relatives</span></a>
