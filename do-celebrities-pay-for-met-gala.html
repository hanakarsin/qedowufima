Held at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the annual spring event serves to raise money and unveil new exhibitions within the museum's Costume Institute.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Some of the best-known and most stylish A-listers turn out for the event, which is why it's affectionately become known as "fashion's biggest night out." Getting an invite (or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not getting an invite</a>) can be very telling about where a star stands in the world of fashion — or at least in the eyes of <a href=#>Anna Wintour</a>.</p><p>While the event is technically a fundraiser, many have wondered if celebrities actually pay to attend the Met Gala. And if not, how do they get an invite for free?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">To go to the Met Gala for free, you have to be chosen by a designer who has a table.</h2><p>The only way to attend the Met Gala for free is to be chosen by a designer who has a table and whose work will be featured at the event. If you're selected, then you'll be dressed by that designer in an outfit which they feel matches the theme — and wearing their design is your ticket in.</p><p>The cost of a table at the Met Gala is between $200,000 to $300,000, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Evening Standard,</a> meaning a designer will purchase at least one table for that amount and then fill it with celebrities and influencers who they have dressed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How much does it cost to go to the Met Gala if you're not invited?</h2><p>If you're determined to get a seat at a table at any Met Gala event, expect to shell out some serious cash. If you don't have an invite from a designer, you can reportedly expect to pay around $50,000 for a ticket (up from the previous price of $30,000, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a>) — and even then, it's really hard to secure a spot if you weren't on the original guest list.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">StyleCaster,</a> the committee for the Met Gala makes a list of names of public figures they believe should be invited. The committee then distributes that list to the various designers who have already purchased tables for the event, suggesting that they dress the celebrities on the list.</p><p>Really, it seems that without someone to dress you, it's impossibly hard to get an invite.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is invited to the 2023 Met Gala?</h2><p>So, who can we expect see?
