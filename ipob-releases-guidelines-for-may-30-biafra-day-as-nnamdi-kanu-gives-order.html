This great event will start on 27th and end on 30th of May.</p><p>“There won’t be any sit- at -home or indoors because our people stayed much days at home during the coronavirus lockdown.

Every individual and group(s) should observe this years prayer designed to remember our fallen heroes and heroines who paid the ultimate price for our living.</p><p>“Nigeria government and her partners in crime decided to wipe out the whole race but God Almighty in Heaven, ‘Chukwu Okike Abiama’ said no to that through these our brethren who sacrificed their lives for us to live.</p><p>“Therefore, IPOB families and Biafrans across countries of the world are encouraged to use this year’s anniversary to pray for all our fallen heroes including all those who were killed by the overzealous Nigeria security personnel in the course of the renewed quest to restore Biafra.</p><p>“We shall also use this year’s event to pray for divine protection of all Biafrans everywhere on the surface of the earth against the covid-19 pandemic ravaging the world. We shall also pray for the speedy recovery of all those infested with the scourge, and for immediate end of the global pandemic.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH12e5FvZqKon5d6s7HLnpisnaNitLa1w56joqaVqHqnu9FmpJqxXWh9bq7Imp2rmV2Zrrp5wKxkp6aRorGqecqapa5ll57Dpr%2BMqKmdnaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emmylou-harris-html.html><span>←</span><span>Emmylou Harris - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
