Hence, some of his trusted players could also leave the club next summer.</p><p>A player like Virgil van Dijk who joined Liverpool from Southampton for a transfer fee worth £75 million in January 2018 could be among the top stars to escort Klopp out of the club.</p><p>The contract between the 32-year-old Netherlands international and Liverpool will expire on June 30, 2025, and there is no sign that the contract will be renewed. Hence, his future at Anfield is very uncertain.</p><p>When asked if he is likely to stay at Liverpool after Klopp’s exit, Van Dijk replied, “That’s a big question. I’m not certain.”</p><p>He continued, “The club will have a big job on their hands, that is well known. To replace not only the manager but the whole staff and there are so many things that will change.</p><p>“I’m very curious which direction that will go in, but when that will be announced we will see our situation.”</p><p>Virgil van Dijk added, “It will be the end of Jurgen Klopp’s era – I am still part of it that’s why I don’t like to talk about it – and that is my main focus.</p><p>“Hopefully, we will have the success we all dream of and by then probably there will be more clarification about what the club wants for the future and then we will see.”</p><p>Aside from Virgil van Dijk who is not sure of his future at the club, some other important players like Trent Alexander-Arnold and Mohamed Salah are also not sure of staying at the club after Klopp’s exit.</p><p>The aforementioned players have until June 30, 2025, before their current contract expires. While it is likely that Alexander-Arnold will get a contract extension offer, Salah who is wanted by Saudi Pro League clubs for record-breaking deals, could be tempted to leave Anfield now that Klopp is on his way out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FyZq%2Bhopy2rXnVmqVmnJmfuG610masp6ulp7Juu8VmqZ6lkZ67qrrGZpitZZyew6a%2Bz6impWWRm8Gmvoyko6iooKh6psTIrWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-nigerian-political-class-is-hard-of-hearing-ezekwesili.html><span>←</span><span>The Nigerian Political Class Is Hard Of Hearing</span></a>
