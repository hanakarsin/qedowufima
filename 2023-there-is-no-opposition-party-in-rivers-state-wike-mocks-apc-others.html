Every day people from All Progressives Congress (APC) are joining our party. We are here doing that and some people are in Abuja; ask them how many persons have they brought to the party.</p><p>“It’s not to say I’m supporting our candidate. How many people have you brought to help your candidate. We are here everyday bringing people to join our party and you are there following your candidate from Abuja to Adamawa. Is it there you’ll win the votes? Come back home.”</p><p>Wike stressed that Rivers state is too strategic politically to be ignored by any serious-minded politician who wants to win an election.</p><p>He said: “This Local Government alone, Obio Akpor, where I come from, we registered not less than 600 thousand voters. This local government beats two States in their electoral strength.</p><p>“So, we are not a state that you can take for granted, not to talk about the Local Government where I come from.</p><p>“I believe that they must know us here because we have what it takes to deliver. They must come and know us. I’m not going to find anybody. You must come here. You can’t take 600 and something thousand votes away from my local government. You can’t take 3.2million votes from my State just like that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5ByZmtoYmh6tbTEq5xmoaNiu7B5zqmnqKuZqbawuoypmKusqWK2r3nRoq2eqqNiwLWt055ksKGbmnquu8KkqmaZoJh6sMDHnqmsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./partner-track-season-2.html><span>←</span><span>Will There Be a 'Partner Track' Season 2?
