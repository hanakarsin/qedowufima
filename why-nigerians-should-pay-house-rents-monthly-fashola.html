How many houses are empty and unoccupied? Why are they empty? Why are they not occupied? Some of the reason is because of the way we collect rent. That is not the only reason.</p><p>“But if you do not understand how dramatic and painful that three-, four, or five-year rent has become to our nation, we have not consciously done anything to it except perhaps in Lagos by passing rent control law. And I think that instead of just complaining about housing every state House of Assembly did something that brought down that pain.</p><p>“Can we bring it down from three years to one year? Can we hopefully bring it down to six months? Can we let it coincide with when people get paid at the end of the month?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze49yZrCgqWK7qrPEq6CapqNiwKm71KWbZqiRrnqpu9SsnGaqlaPBtHnMqKWtoJyueqet0qGmpZlf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happens-to-the-songs-not-chosen-on-songland.html><span>←</span><span>What Happens to the Songs Not Chosen on 'Songland'?
