The Camp Rock actress, like many folks, uploaded a photo of a ginormous Turkey that was roasted and primed for consumption for Thanksgiving. She put a caption on the picture that read, "I'm thankful for all of you" followed by a heart emoji.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, some of her followers weren't gobbling up the turkey day well wishes from the 28-year-old. Several people had pointed out a photo Demi was featured in a few days earlier that seems to contradict her bird-gobbling Instagram. Farm Sanctuary featured a picture of the artist hugging a Turkey on its Facebook page during her on-location visit to help promote kindness towards animals.</p><p>The caption read: "The turkeys were so excited to meet Demi Lovato at our California Sanctuary! Thanks for visiting, Demi, we loved having you!"</p><p>The message continued, "Choose compassion this Thanksgiving and sponsor one of our rescued turkeys..." It was then followed up with a link that folks could click in order to save a turkey's life.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>What's more is that Demi had posted a slew of her own photos from her experience at the Farm Sanctuary with animals "who were all rescued from cruelty."</p><p>She wrote, "The highlight of my tour was cuddling with a rescued turkey named Sandy. Not only are these animals cute, but they are forgiving. The animals at @farmsanctuary had to learn to trust humans after what they had been through, and their strength and resilience is amazing!"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It didn't take long for several people to label Demi's posts as hypocritical and a ton of memes about the dichotomy of her trip to the sanctuary and her Instagram Thanksgiving Day post started popping up all over Twitter.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>TODAY IN CRINGE: Demi Lovato poses with turkey in photo promoting animal sanctuary that fights animal agriculture.
