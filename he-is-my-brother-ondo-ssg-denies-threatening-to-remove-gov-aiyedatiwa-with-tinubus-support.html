If the online platform knows of any constitutional infraction committed by the Governor to warrant him being thrown out, the online news platform should say so but as for me I don’t know any.</p><p>“As someone who understands Mr President’s respect for order, and who has enormous respect for the office and person of the President, I would never even think of bringing him into any matter that will be a mere distraction to him even if there is any, and in any case where is the power tussle that the online news is talking about?</p><p>“Honourable Lucky Ayedatiwa is the Governor, and that is not in dispute. Also, I have enormous respect for the office of Governor and will always respect Governor Ayedatiwa, who is my brother.”</p><p>Odu added that Aiyedatiwa has the full backing of the constitution. Hence, she has no reason to call such a person an impostor, warning those spreading lies to be wary of how posterity would judge them.</p><p>“Those who wish to cause crisis in the state should remember that posterity will judge them, and the spirit of the founding fathers of the state will stand against them.</p><p>“Why would any right thinking person call Mr Lucky Ayedatiwa who was duly sworn in as Governor by the Chief Judge of the state an impostor? Again I say that if the online platform knows what qualifies Ayedatiwa as an impostor it is free to let it out but I am not an illiterate who will use words without knowing the meaning,” she queried.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5BvZqGdXZ7AbrnYZpmrp6SdsrN5zqebqGWjqLRusMSnoJ6rXam1s7HArZynoZ6cerW7jKucpqemmnqou9VmmKKxlZmutbXWmmSwoaSderW1za6ZrqtdqMKxvM6rq2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shane-harper-html.html><span>←</span><span>Shane Harper - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
