Very unlikely indeed.</p><p>“Assuming without conceding that they even produce the President, can they (LP) run the government? Not likely. The results of 5 and 6 above will be to form a minority Government with devastating effect on National political stability further impelling the fragile health of our Country.</p><p>“Furthermore, there is no way a keen political observer will not see that there is a major disconnect between Peter Obi as a candidate and Labour, which is indicative of the fact that he is not running a collegial political structure in a diverse Country like Nigeria.</p><p>“It is, however, respectively observed that LP is a party to be watched in the future only if it sustains the tempo and maintains the mass movement while at the same time building up its structures towards subsequent elections.</p><h2>NNPP Not Planning For 2023</h2><p>The Northern Christian leaders added that they opted against <strong>Rabiu Kwankwaso</strong> and his New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) because it doesn’t seem like they are gunning for the 2023 polls.</p><p>Dogara and his people argued that NNPP seems to be positioning for the future.</p><p>“The NNPP on the other hand has similar characteristics with the LP and there is no need repeating same except that ~ NNPP appears to be building a party for the future with – little or no impact in the 2023 elections,” they said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze49rZmtoYmh6uLTYZq6eZaKat6av056bZqiVqbKzec6boGacn5yus62Mp6arrJiav695wqGpoquknq6vecuemJ2doqh6s7HVnpilZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-charles-first-gay-bachlelor.html><span>←</span><span>Twitter Went Into a Frenzy When Someone Said James Charles Should Be the First Gay Bachelor</span></a>
