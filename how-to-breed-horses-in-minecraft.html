But before getting into specifics about how to breed horses, you first have to find two wild ones. Wild horses can typically be found in biomes with lots of grass – such as plains – and are often found in groups of up to six individuals.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Mojang</span></figure><p>Once you’ve spotted a horse, you can tame it by interacting with it. This will have you climb on top of the horse for a short ride. It might buck you off a few times, though you’ll eventually see a bunch of floating hearts appear when your taming attempt was successful. If a horse bucks you off, just keep interacting with it until these hearts appear.</p><p>Do this to a second horse to acquire two tamed horses. Be sure to keep your eye on the first horse so it doesn’t wander off (you can use a Lead to tie it down or build a makeshift stable around it with any blocks in your inventory).</p><p>Now that you’ve tamed them, here’s how to breed horses in Minecraft.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Mojang</span></figure><ul><li>Bring your two tamed horses into close contact with each other. This is easily done by building a small stable around them.</li><li>Feed each one either a Golden Apple or Golden Carrot. This will cause hearts to appear and activates their breeding mode. (Note<strong>:</strong> A Golden Apple can be crafted by placing an apple in the middle of the crafting table and surrounding it with Gold Ingots. A Golden Carrot is crafted by crafting a carrot surrounded by Gold Nuggets.)</li></ul><ul><li>If the two horses will eventually mate and create a baby horse. This will grow into an adult in less than an hour, although you can speed up the process by feeding it food items like hay and wheat.</li></ul><p>Keep in mind that your baby horse will have stats that are based on its parents. So, if you’re trying to bred a fast horse, you’ll want to bred the two fastest horses in your stable. And while color patterns have a slight chance of being random, breeding two horses with the same pattern are more likely to result in offspring with the same pattern.</p><p>Once you’ve successfully bred a horse, be sure to <a href=#>craft a saddle</a> so you can ride it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZJuqlZqxbrTOq6qeq12eu265yKecnKqRm8E%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./guns-n-roses-html.html><span>←</span><span>Guns N' Roses - Members, Ages, Trivia</span></a>
