In it, five two-person teams race across the world to see who gets to the predetermined destination first. They aren't allowed to fly, but they can use any other form of transportation.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>And although Season 2 of Race Across the World already aired on BBC Two in the UK, many new fans are wondering when it was filmed. So far, the series has only been around for two seasons, but with an already dedicated following and the show picking up more fans as they discover it, more seasons are almost certain at this point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But when was 'Race Across the World' Season 2 filmed?</h2><p>Race Across the World Season 2 was filmed in 2019. Because it originally aired in 2020, it's no big shocker that it was shot the year before. It started in Mexico City and took contestants around the world as each team raced to get to Argentina.</p><p>Typically, there is a no-fly rule, as flying would make travel faster for some participants than others. This season, however, because of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>civil unrest in Ecuador</u></a>, the teams were permitted to fly from Colombia to Peru for safety reasons.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is 'Race Across the World' the same thing as 'The Amazing Race'?</h2><p>At its core, Race Across the World isn't vastly different from The Amazing Race, which has aired on CBS since 2001. There are official international versions of The Amazing Race in Australia and even China, but Race Across the World isn't an actual offshoot of the U.S. series millions of fans tune in to each season.</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>FIVE teams took on a challenge of a lifetime racing 54 days across South America, and what a journey we‚Äôve been on with them. üåé‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è<a href=#>#RaceAcrossTheWorld</a>, series 2‚Ä¶.

Therefore, those who have already seen the series air originally know which team wins. And, spoiler alert, it's Emon and Jamiul Choudhury, an uncle and nephew pair who reunited after spending 10 years apart from each other and had reconnected just a few months before they went on the show. Naturally, Race Across the World was the perfect place to build a relationship again.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Emon and Jamiul are Uncle and Nephew GOALS!</p><p>Let's hear it for the <a href=#>#RaceAcrosstheWorld</a> winners! üëèüåéüòÉ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zM7j7C67JZ</a></p>‚Äî BBC Two (@BBCTwo) <a href=#>May 11, 2020</a></figure><p>Following their epic win, the uncle and nephew team planned to give away <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>75 percent of their winnings</u></a> to charitable causes, including a Bangladesh orphanage.
