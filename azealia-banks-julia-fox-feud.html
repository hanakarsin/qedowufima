Now that the pair officially announced their split, it seems many have a bone to pick with the Uncut Gems star, especially <a href=#>resident feuder Azealia Banks</a>.</p><p>After learning of Julia and Ye's break-up, the "212" rapper took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> and exposed plenty of private messages between her and Julia. Not only that, but Azealia also took shots at Julia's drug use and her son, Valentino. So, did Julia respond? When did their feud start? Here's everything you need to know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Azealia Banks initiated a feud with Julia Fox and made some shocking claims.</h2><p>Following Julia announcing she and Ye parted ways, several outlets claimed the 32-year-old was spotted crying in Los Angeles. In response, she shared a statement on her Instagram story.</p><p>"Y'all would love if I [were] soooo upset!" she wrote for her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1.2 million followers</a> to see. "The media would love to paint a picture of me, a sad, lonely woman crying on a plane by myself, but it's NOT TRUE!! Why not see me for what I am, which is a No. 1 hustler."</p><p>The 30-year-old "Black Madonna" vocalist was quick to dismiss Julia's message, screenshotting her statement and writing via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot New Hip Hop,</a> "We already know the tea Foolia! [You] came to Miami looking for sex work, [the] same lawyer was in contract with Ye, and it was a weak PR stunt from the jump."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Azealia Banks criticizes Julia Fox about the book that she intends to release exposing Kanye West. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/khvAnjcqpg</a></p>— Female Rap Room (@girlsinrap) <a href=#>February 15, 2022</a></figure><p>She continued, "What did you hustle him for? A bag and some Lucien's? You absolutely did not come up because, if this is how women who 'always date billionaires' behave when s--t goes south, threatening tell-all books ... You can kiss your days as a low-rate escort goodbye, sis."</p><p>Azealia also mentioned Julia's drug use, later calling her a "liability" to Ye and sharing screenshots of a text exchange in which the No Sudden Move actress warned Azealia to not "talk s--t about [her] son." Of course, the controversial figure didn't listen and proceeded to say Julia's son was a "crack baby."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Julia Fox clapped back with her own set of screenshots.</h2><p>Julia clapped back at Azaelia on her Instagram story.</p><p>"I’m open about my issues with addiction because I want to destigmatize it! Not [all] addicts are 'junkies.' That is so horrible to say," she said via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Uproxx</a>. "It’s a real f--king disease. And I’ve also been open about my recovery journey!!! But nobody wants to mention that right[?]"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom)</a></p></figure><p>Julia added, "If this troll says one more thing about my parenting or my son... I was too nice to her [because] I felt sorry for her, but now I realize there’s a reason why she spends all the holidays alone. Nobody wants that energy sis!!!"</p><p>Then, the former fashion designer elevated their public feud by sharing alleged text messages of Azealia asking her for help soliciting drugs, including molly and Percocet, which Azealia claims were not for her.</p><p>Eventually, things got worse after Azealia posted a photo of Julia taking drugs through intravenous injection. Nothing else has been uttered between the two, so it appears their feud is settled ... for now.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know needs help, use </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>SAMHSA Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator</strong></a><strong> to find support for mental health and substance use disorders in your area or call 1-800-662-4357 for 24-hour assistance.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflsemrcuimGaakaO4tHnJrqOimV2bvLl5xZ6snQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./osun-adeleke-reacts-to-accusation-of-certificate-forgery-as-oyetola-drags-him-to-tribunal.html><span>←</span><span>Adeleke Reacts To Accusation Of Certificate Forgery As Oyetola Drags Him To Tribunal</span></a>
