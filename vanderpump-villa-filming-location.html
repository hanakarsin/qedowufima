[I was] just super grateful just to be there. But it was it was challenging. You know, because you're going, I don't even know how many miles it is. But it's a long way. You're leaving everybody, and you're going to live with strangers.

I've learned so much about myself.

Vanderpump Villa viewers are also privy to visiting Lisa’s latest business baby — for the right price.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tripadvisor</a>, the Chateau Rosabelle costs $497 per night. The hefty price includes three bedrooms, one bath, with five beds and a sofa. The listing’s description also states guests will have access to the chateau’s stunning outdoor scenery, including its park and gardens, which have been the destination for weddings and proposals.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span><p>(l-r): Marciano Brunette and Hannah Fouch</p></figure><p>The chateau’s romantic scenery is something guests specifically pay the big bucks for. However, working in the love hub with your ex, like <a href=#>Hannah Fouch and Marciano Brunette,</a> is not as exciting. Nonetheless, Marciano told Distractify they were both “so lucky” to have experienced France together and said there will “definitely be a lot more traveling in our upcoming future.”</p><p>For now, you can catch the cast frolicking around France on Vanderpump Villa.
