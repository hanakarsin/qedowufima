So who's expected in Hall H this year? Some of the guests might surprise you.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The Witcher</h2><p>The Netflix-branded series based off of the books and video game of the same name follows the adventures of Geralt of Rivia, played with Henry Cavill.</p><p>The series is heavily steeped in swords and spells, and Netflix is betting hard on the fact that Game of Thrones fans are going to look for something to fill that specific entertainment void in their life. The Witcher, with a star as well-known as Cavill who is no stranger to Comic Con, could very well be that show. If Henry is on The Witcher panel in Hall H, it'll be his first non-Superman appearance at Comic Con.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance</h2><p>If you were a weirdo kid in the 80s and early 90s who also happened to love Jim Henson, then Labyrinth and The Dark Crystal were probably two of your most-prized VHS tapes. Netflix has commissioned 10-episodes steeped in the very strange Dark Crystal world and there's a ton of top talent attached to the project: Sigourney Weaver, Taron Egerton, Lena Headey, Alicia Vikander, Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill, and Akwafina are just a few of the big names a part of Dark Crystal.</p><p>A panel for the new Netflix series should feature a few of those big names, so fans attending the monstrous convention in San Diego could get a chance to interact with them and ask about their work on the puppet prequel.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Star Trek: Discovery and Star Trek: Lower Decks</h2><p>It wouldn't be a "nerd" convention without a Star Trek project taking some of the spotlight, and there are two Trek shows that fans will be happy to see holding panels at Hall H. Star Trek: Discovery is entering its third season with Sonequa Martin-Green as the lead.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><p>Lower Decks is an animated series in the Trek universe and the panel will be presented by EP Mike McMahan, who also worked on Rick & Morty. Yes, it's a comedy, and an irreverent one that fans will probably gobble up. Alex Kurtzman, in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline article</a>, talked about how excited he is to have Mike a part of the project.</p><p>"Mike won our hearts with his first sentence: ‘I want to do a show about the people who put the yellow cartridge in the food replicator so a banana can come out the other end, Alex said."</p><p>"His cat’s name is Riker. His son’s name is Sagan. The man is committed. He’s brilliantly funny and knows every inch of every Trek&nbsp;episode, and that’s his secret sauce: he writes with the pure, joyful heart of a true fan. As we broaden the world of Trek to fans of all ages, we’re so excited to include Mike’s extraordinary voice.”</p><p>Also on deck for Hall H is an appearance by Patrick Stewart, who is going to be on board for the Picard Panel. CBS All Access is calling their little takeover of the hall SDCC 50</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</h2><p>The TV show that follows the agency doing the dirty work surrounding the superheroes in the Marvel universe will be getting its first-ever Hall H appearance. Marvel games will also have a panel that starts at 1:30pm, where Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order, Iron Man VR, and Marvel's Avengers games will get demoed in front of fans.</p><p>Although the full programming schedule for Comic Con has yet to be finalized, it's easy to see that it's already jam-packed. If you were lucky enough to score some tickets, you can check the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official San Diego Comic Con website to see what they've got in store</a>. It isn't populated yet, but since the event's coming up, the schedule should be up there before long.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: abc</span></figure><p>So who are you most excited to see at Hall H? I just wanna ask Henry Cavill <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to reload his biceps</a> like he did in Mission: Impossible and I'll be good.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna6tuIyhZJynnZ6wbq%2FOp2RraGFu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-daughtry-html.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Daughtry - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
