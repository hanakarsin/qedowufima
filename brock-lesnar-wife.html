She married her first husband, Wayne Richardson, in 1987. Sadly, he died in a drunk driving incident in 1991.</p><p>Rena’s second husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc Mero</a>, is what ultimately led her to become Mrs. Lesnar.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Rena made her debut in the WWE in the late '90s as Sable.</h2><p>When Rena debuted in WWE (then the World Wrestling Federation (WWF)) in 1996 she was primarily a manager to then real-life husband "Wildman" Marc Mero. The duo worked together until he got hurt in 1997. While her husband was recuperating, Rena began expanding her role from manager to in-ring performer known as Sable and her popularity skyrocketed.</p><p>By the time Marc returned from injury, Sable was the bigger star. Rena and Mark were married from 1994 until 2004.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-cbeQSR faRvJV"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Sable won her first WWE Women's title in 1998.</h2><p>Sable won the WWE <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Women's Title</a> in late 1998 and held it for 175 days. During her run, she became the first WWE female superstar to appear on the cover of Playboy.</p><p>Her popularity helped usher in the Divas era of WWE. The April 1999 issue of the magazine is one of the magazine’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">highest-selling issues</a>. It helps explain why she was put on the cover again just six months later in September 1999.</p><p>She was on the cover again in March 2004, this time with fellow Diva <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Torrie Wilson</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Torrie Wilson and Sable at the WrestleMania XX press conference</p></figure><p>Sable initially left the WWE in July 1999. She filed a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$110 million lawsuit </a>against the company, alleging sexual harassment and unsafe working conditions.</p><p>In her time away from WWE she appeared in the film <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Corky Romano</a> and released an autobiography and a comic book. The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and she returned to the WWE in 2003.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Sable and Brock Lesnar began dating during her second WWE run in 2004.</h2><p>When Brock Lesnar left the company after WrestleMania XX in March 2004, Sable left WWE for good just five months later in August 2004.</p><p>The two married in 2006 and have two sons, Turk, born June 3, 2009, and Duke, born July 21, 2010. She also has a daughter, Mariah, from her first marriage and Brock has two children, twins Luke and Nicole, with former fiancée, Nicole McClain.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Brock Lesnar and Sable in 2011</p></figure><p>"She's a solid rock in my life. I can't imagine coming home to someone different," Brock told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sports Illustrated</a> of his wife in 2011. "I don't think another woman would have lasted with me."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">What’s Rena doing now?</h2><p>Though she was omnipresent on WWE programming in the late '90s, Sable is rarely seen these days. She’s not on social media. She was seen at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">UFC 200</a> on July 9, 2016, after Brock defeated Mark Hunt.</p><p>She is occasionally mentioned in passing by her husband on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWE programming</a>, but other than that, she is no longer a public figure. A fan photo shared on Twitter in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">August 2022</a> is the last time she was tagged on social media.</p><p>Sable, Brock, and their brood currently live in Maryfield, Saskatchewan, Canada.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2Bwr8pmo56rnpa%2FbsPIn5w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kwara-state-gov-abdulrazaq-called-thief-disgraced-by-aggrieved-apc-members-video.html><span>←</span><span>Kwara State Gov, Abdulrazaq Called Thief, Disgraced By Aggrieved APC Members (Video)</span></a>
