Kim Parker from ‘Moesha’ and ‘The Parkers’</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>For so many plus-size baddies (including myself), Kim Parker, played by the iconic <a href=#>Countess Vaughn</a>, was the fashion blueprint. What Kim lacked in her studies, she made up for with her bold style, slightly gaudy makeup, and hairstyles that would change weekly on <a href=#>Moesha</a> and her spinoff, <a href=#>The Parkers</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On The Parkers, Kim was also the leader of the legendary Freestyle Unity and had no problem sharing her sultry, soulful voice whenever possible.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nikki Parker from ‘The Parkers’</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Professor Stanley Oglevee didn’t have good taste because Nikki Parker <a href=#>(Mo’Nique)</a> from The Parkers was a plus-size baddie. Like her daughter, Kim, Nikki had a flair for fashion and beauty and always kept a cute hairstyle in her arsenal. While I can’t get behind her thirst for Stanley, played by Dorian Wilson, I’m glad the character found the love she wanted and looked good while doing it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Khadijah James from ‘Living Single’</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>In honor of Living Single day, I would like to recognize Khadijah “Keep A Baddie” James. All my girl mens was tall, fine & they had jobs. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zjoCIG1SZ3</a></p>— gabby.💐✨ (@xogabbyelle_) <a href=#>August 23, 2023</a></figure><p>Miss Khadijah James <a href=#>(Queen Latifah)</a> was a force that no one dared to reckon with for five seasons of <a href=#>Living Single</a>. This plus-size baddie was an entrepreneur with her own magazine, Flavor, a brownstone in Brooklyn (with two other roommates, but still!), and a silk press that wouldn’t quit if you begged it. And let’s not forget that Khadijah was the queen of the “mack” and always had a cutie on her arm!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Raven Baxter from ‘That’s So Raven’</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Another plus-size baddie who is also a fashion icon is Raven Baxter, played by <a href=#>Raven Symone</a>. The fearless fashion designer was always dressed to impress and stood up for herself when she received flack for her weight. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">That’s So Raven</a> stans recall the baddie slaying a runway after a designer told her off for photoshopping a slimmer person’s body onto Raven’s face.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Galleria from ‘The Cheetah Girls’</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Nope, you’re not seeing double! Raven is Muva and played two plus-size baddies within the same decade! During her Disney Channel days, Raven starred in <a href=#>The Cheetah Girls</a> as <a href=#>Galleria Garibaldi</a>.</p><p>Galleria never played small and was her group’s leader. Though she could definitely get a little problematic, she was the plus-size boss girls needed to see!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Mavis from ‘Survival of the Thickest’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/L4qIj2tZS/200x200/elizabeth-randolph-1653392724099.jpg><p>Mavis Beaumont <a href=#>(Michelle Buteau)</a> from <a href=#>Survival of the Thickest</a> may be the newest plus-size baddie to aspire to since the show aired in 2023, but she is just as fierce as the ones many are more familiar with. Mavis’s quirky personality and love for style make her intriguing to watch, as well as her relatable moments as a single woman trying to get her life back after a messy breakup. Mavis is also a stylist herself and encourages her clients to dress for their body type rather than everyone’s opinions.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. Kelli from ‘Insecure’</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>I said it when it was on the air, and I’ll say it again: <a href=#>Insecure</a> should’ve given us more of Kelli Prenny!! Played by <a href=#>Natasha Rothwell</a>, the character was one of the funniest characters in scripted TV and always said the first thing on her mind.</p><p>However, what’s less appreciated about Kelli is the fact that she was a certified baddie. Kelli always rocked the outfits that real-life plus-size bloggers would wear. And she always wore her natural curls, which always looked pristine.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Mercedes from ‘Glee’</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. Gloria from ‘Waiting to Exhale’</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In the movie <a href=#>Waiting to Exhale</a>, Gloria, <a href=#>Loretta Devine</a>’s character, is a plus-size baddie who needs a little help being convinced she is a plus-size baddie. Like many women, Gloria felt insecure about her body after gaining weight. Sis almost blocked her own blessings when she wouldn’t allow her love interest, Marvin (Gregory Hines), to love her. Eventually, though, she gave in and was the only one in her friend group with a healthy relationship once the movie ended.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. Coretta from ‘The Steve Harvey Show’ AND Baby D from ‘Next Friday’</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The Lady of Rage was one plus-size baddie who doesn’t get enough credit for her impact on the culture. During the ‘90s, she played two, I’ll just say, misunderstood characters — Coretta and Baby D.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Lady of Rage</a>’s character, Coretta, was known as the school bully on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Steve Harvey Show</a>. However, in between her tough girl moments was a sweet side to the character. And although she mostly wore baggy clothes, Lady of Rage’s natural beauty radiated in all her scenes. The character’s small role as Big Dee in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Next Friday</a> is also incredibly iconic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbyxecKuo62topp6sbjUrGSsoaqaeqOtw52gnqs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tafari-campbell-cause-of-death.html><span>←</span><span>Obama Chef Tafari Campbell Died Paddleboarding Near Martha's Vineyard</span></a>
