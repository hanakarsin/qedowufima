You don’t announce in advance where your presidential candidate will come from and in any case, there must be criteria for presidential aspiration.</p><p>“Any Nigerian from any part of the country can aspire from any party, but the issue is when you localize it to a particular party, which party will actually want to win and form the next government and will look out for the most popular candidate. Zoning is not the answer.”</p><p>He said political parties will always look for who can win election to form the next government which may determine where to zone presidency.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BvZmtoYmh6u7vNoqWgZZGlsG680Z6qopyVo8Gqrctmq6Kbm5rBbrrOrWStoJVirq%2B%2F1p6pZquVo661u9Fmma6km5awqcHWmmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./312581-mambo-ni-magumu-kwa-waititu-huko-kiambu-aamua-kuhamia-nairobi-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mambo ni magumu kwa Waititu huko Kiambu, aamua kuhamia Nairobi</span></a>
