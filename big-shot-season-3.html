Naturally, it’s two different worlds, and Marvyn takes some time to get acclimated before finding his stride.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>With that in mind, Big Shot is already two seasons in. So, fans are wondering what the future holds for the feel-good series. Will Disney Plus roll out Big Shot Season 3? Here’s everything that we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So far, no news has been shared about 'Big Shot' being renewed for Season 3.</h2><p>It’s a tale as old as time. Fans of a series are excited for the continuation of a storyline that has yet to be disclosed by creators or the network. Unfortunately, Big Shot is no exception.</p><p>The reason that Season 3 has yet to be announced may be due to the fact that Season 2 was just released on October 12, 2022. Showrunners may want to pay attention to viewership for the show’s new season before making a decision to greenlight Season 3.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Additionally, showrunners would have to plan out production schedules in order to successfully say that Season 3 will become a reality. Not to mention, it does take networks and creator’s some time before announcing a new season.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So, while it can be annoying to wait for the announcement, fans of Disney Plus’s Big Shot will simply have to wait until news is shared with the public.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Interestingly, there have been talks of 'Big Shot' being canceled in the past.</h2><p>The wait for Season 3 seems brutal, and it’s understandable why fans are so antsy about it. For starters, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Teal Mango</a> reports that John Stamos actually shared that the show was nearly canceled after Season 1.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Big Shot was not getting picked up after last year,” John said per the outlet. “We were on episode eight or nine out of 10, and I remember saying, ‘Let’s just pick the show up now, we’ll take a month off, write new scripts, ‘cause the girls are going to get old.’ They’re like, ‘Let it air first.’ It comes out, it does whatever.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>John continued, “I said, ‘Will you pick it up now?’ ‘Well, let’s see a few more shows.’ Weeks go by and weeks go by; all 10 come out. So I started calling around. It’s like, ‘Well, it didn’t do well in India, because they don’t play basketball’ — all these analytics and graphs and charts.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The actor shared that he was seemingly getting the run around before the show was ultimately picked up for Season 2.</p><p>That said, only time will tell how Big Shot’s future on Disney Plus will pan out.</p><p>For now, watch Season 1 and 2 of Big Shot on Fridays on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7aoedKhpq1lo5qutLvNZmo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-wike-meets-jonah-jang-useni-over-pdp-crisis.html><span>←</span><span>Wike Meets Jonah Jang, Useni Over PDP Crisis</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
