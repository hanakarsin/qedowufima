And fans are wondering if Caleb (Aaron Paul) is still a human in Westworld Season 4. And the trailer for and first two episodes of the fourth season have done little to answer that question!</p><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Insider</a> recaps, Season 4 shows Caleb looking alive and well in the purported present, raising a daughter named Frankie. But we see him critically wounded in <a href=#>Maeve</a>’s (Thandiwe Newton) memories or visions. We also learn that Frankie was born right when the revolution ended, which is odd timing.</p><p>The trailer for Season 4 shows Caleb reacting to <a href=#>a swarm of flies</a>, which wouldn’t affect a host. But we also see a host who looks suspiciously like Frankie. What’s a Westworld fan supposed to believe?!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Fans are divided about whether Caleb is host or human.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: John Johnson/HBO</span></figure><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a popular Reddit post</a> from Wednesday, July 6, one Westworld fan detailed their theory that Caleb is a host. “[In Episode 1] we see him, in Maeve’s memories, covered in blood. [In Episode 2] she refers to him as [basic] a.k.a. a basic host model without her special abilities,” that user wrote. “I know, I know. It sounds like she means ‘human,’ but this is Westworld. Caleb may or may not know, but Maeve does, and she’s keeping it fun using opaque language.”</p><p>That same Reddit user pointed out that Caleb’s family may not be of blood relation, that perhaps his daughter is from a previous relationship, and that perhaps his wife is a host, too.</p><p>In the comments, another fan speculated that the clues about Caleb’s possible host-ness are red herrings: “I think we’re being led to believe Caleb may be a host, but I think it will be revealed that he’s not. I do believe his wife and daughter are hosts and [believe] his mind may have been f—ked with. It’ll be real interesting to see how that plays out, especially with Maeve’s involvement.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">And some fans are really hoping there’s not a “Caleb is a host” twist.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>On that same Reddit thread, another commenter expressed hope that Caleb is a human. “This just wouldn’t be a fun reveal at this point in the series. Especially with him being a main protagonist,” that commenter observed. “The ‘OMG! ____ is a host!’ gimmick should have ended with the final Season 2 host reveal at the end of the finale episode. If that does end up being the case, I feel like the reveal will be met with more eye rolls than shock and awe. Just my opinion.”</p><p>A fourth user concurred. “It would be boring if all the main characters were hosts and if it was always announced as a big reveal. At this point, it wouldn’t be interesting anymore. However, I believe [Caleb’s] wife is a host and his daughter is the first child born from a human being and a host. The ability of human beings and androids to reproduce together is a common theme when imagining sentient robots, and I expect Westworld to address it, too.”</p><p>Westworld airs on Sundays at 9 p.m. on HBO.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBur8ClnJtlo6m2rbiMmmShrZ2Wu27DxKyrsKeiobE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./petrol-price-set-to-crash-in-nigeria-cbn-governor-cardoso.html><span>←</span><span>Petrol Price Set To Crash In Nigeria</span></a>
