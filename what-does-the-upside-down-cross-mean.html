Religious people who wear an upside-down cross are honoring St. Peter.</p><p>However, this isn't why <a href=#>Ice Spice</a> wore an inverted cross while watching the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers on Super Bowl Sunday.</p><p>Instead, people are saying she wore the inverted cross to reject Christianity, and even to signify that she's an atheist or devil worshipper. Indeed, this is the other meaning of the upside-down cross ‚Äî and paired with other subtle signals the rapper put out there for the world to see, fans are saying she wasn't professing her faith in St. Peter.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nothing to see here, just Taylor Swifts guest Ice Spice throwing up demonic signs while wearing a upside down cross making sure the world sees it on the big screen.</p><p>DEMONS. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/D9ywjZDOR7</a></p>‚Äî AG üî• (@Yolo304741) <a href=#>February 12, 2024</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Fans say Ice Spice threw out satanic symbols at the Super Bowl.</h2><p>Not only did Ice Spice wear an oversized upside-down cross necklace to the big game, but she also donned an outfit by the <a href=#>controversial brand Balenciaga</a>, which has been criticized for promoting child abuse and sex trafficking in its ads.</p><p>Add to those scandalous elements that she was throwing out devil horn hand signs when she knew the camera was on the famous friends' box, and social media lit up with commentary ‚Äî which was likely <a href=#>Ice Spice's</a> intent.</p><p>"This Ice Spice thing is so unnatural and forced.
