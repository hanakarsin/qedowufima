While appearing on the cover of <a href=#>Vogue</a> in May of 2019, the <a href=#>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</a> personality shocked readers by declaring her intention to become an attorney.</p><p>Without a college degree or a spot in a formal law school, Kim's journey toward taking the bar exam has been unconventional.</p><p>In order to continue on with her four-year program in California, the SKIMS founder had to pass the baby bar exam after her first year of education.</p><p>In a teaser for the May 27 episode of the E! series, Kim revealed that she did not pass the test — and many fans want to know what exactly that means for her.</p><p>Read on for the breakdown of Kim's baby bar exam results, and to learn how she's aiming to achieve her goals.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Kim Kardashian shared her bar exam results, but what exactly is the baby bar?</h2><p>Because Kim is enrolled in a four-year apprenticeship with human rights attorney and #Cut50 founder Jessica Jackson, she had to take the First Year Law Students' Examination aka the baby bar exam at the end of her first year.</p><p>The test is a shortened, one-day version of the real bar exam. The step is mandatory in order to determine if someone like Kim is being adequately trained in a non-law school setting.</p><p>In a teaser for KUWTK, Kim told her sisters, Kourtney and <a href=#>Khloé Kardashian</a>, that she didn't get a high enough score to be done with the baby bar.</p><p>"I did not pass the baby bar," she admitted in the sneak peek.</p><p>In her confessional, the KKW Beauty founder shared why she had to take the exam in the first place.</p><p>"If you do law school the way that I'm doing it, it is a four-year program instead of your typical three-year program. After Year 1, you have to take the baby bar," she said. "This one is actually harder, I hear, than the official bar."</p><p>The clip then showed a video call between Kim and Jessica.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>"You needed a 560. You got a 474," Jessica explained. "That's extremely close on a test that most people are not taking in the middle of a pandemic."</p><p>"I am a failure," Kim told her tutor. She then discussed how she spent six weeks studying for the exam, and that her "spirit [was] down" because she didn't pass.</p><p>Though she debated taking the exam a month later (which was in November of 2020), Kim has since confirmed that she still has not passed.</p><p>On May 26, Kim did a Q&A with her fans on Instagram. When one asked how her bar preparation was going, Kim said that she was struggling to get a high enough score.</p><p>"Extremely difficult," she said when asked about how she was finding the exams. "Unfortunately, I haven't passed yet, but I'm not giving up and I'm preparing to take it again soon."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What law school is Kim Kardashian in? Did she share an LSAT score?</h2><p>As previously mentioned, the businesswoman is not enrolled in a law school. Instead of spending three years in a formal program, Kim elected to do an apprenticeship for four years.</p><p>Because Kim is hoping to become a lawyer in California, she does not need to have an undergraduate degree or to have attended law school. She just needs to be able to pass the bar, but the Golden State is notorious for having one of the hardest bar exams in the country.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>While some fans have been searching for Kim's LSAT (Law School Admission Test) score, she most likely did not take that exam. Kim has not directly shared whether she did sit for the test, but she would not have needed to do so in order to begin her apprenticeship.</p><p>It remains to be seen if Kim will complete her apprenticeship and ultimately pass the bar.</p><p>The final season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs on Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on E!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLauecqaqZ2Zo522orqMm5irZZWtrq550Z6qrqSkqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1238063-cnn-brianna-keilar-bio-age-pregnancy-husband-divorce-net-worth-html.html><span>←</span><span>CNN Brianna Keilar bio: age, pregnancy, husband, divorce, net worth</span></a>
