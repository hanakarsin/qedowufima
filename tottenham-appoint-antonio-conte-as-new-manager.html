Now that the opportunity has returned, I have chosen to take it with great conviction.”</p><p>Naija News reports that Spurs attempted to sign Conte before appointing Nuno in the summer. Nuno was relieved of his duties on Monday after less than five months at the club, with Saturday’s 3-0 defeat to Manchester United his final game in charge.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye49rZq2npKmyr7TApmSaqKCktq%2FAjJqlraeenrxur86nq55lkah6r7HWZqSappGcsrN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kola-ologbondiyan.html><span>←</span><span>Read All The Latest News About Kola Ologbondiyan On Naija News</span></a>
