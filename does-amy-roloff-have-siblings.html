What even seasoned fans of the Oregon family might not have much knowledge about, however, are Amy's parents and siblings. Did she grow up an only child? Or does the LPBW star have brothers and sisters?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Amy Roloff have any siblings?</h2><p>She does! Growing up, Amy was actually the youngest of four children belonging to Gordon and Patricia Knight. Amy's siblings include: Two sisters, Cyndi (who died in 2015) and Katherine, and one brother, Roger.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Amy's brother, Roger, stood up to one of her bullies.</h2><p>"We played quite well together," her brother, Roger, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said on LPBW</a> while discussing his and Amy's childhood relationship. "We were either on or completely at each other."</p><p>"But why would I have been mad at you?" Amy said with a laugh, to which he pointed out that he would tease her.</p><p>"It probably started when I was starting to get a little taller, faster, stronger," Roger explained. "But as much as I did torment her, there were times when I rallied and stuck up for her."</p><p>One such time was when a boy from school kept following Amy home and "saying nasty stuff" to her ‚Äî so her brother fought him. "He was a punk. I mean, he was four years older than I was," Roger recalled. "Then we got in a WWE wrestling match and he ended up giving up. And he never bothered you again, I don't think."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: TLC/YouTube</span></figure><p>Roger went on to share that he would get called out of school early to walk Amy home before everyone else because of the ongoing bullying she faced. "You were getting harassed and they were afraid you would not get home safely," he said.</p><p>"Things from your childhood can affect you for the rest of your life," Amy said of experiencing bullying as a kid. "And I know it's affected me for a long, long time ‚Äî allowing other people's opinions and thoughts to matter more than what I truly thought about myself."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Amy's sister, Cyndi, died in 2015.</h2><p>In April 2019, Amy posted an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram photo</a> of herself and her then-boyfriend, Chris Marek (they're engaged now) after taking a motorcycle ride together ‚Äî and in doing so, she referenced her sister.</p><p>"It also reminds me so much of my oldest sister Cyndi, she passed away from an illness 4 years ago, who loved to ride," Amy wrote.

I love riding with this man! ‚ù§Ô∏è. Im amazed how much I do love to ride. First I love being with Chris‚ù§Ô∏è. It also reminds me so much of my oldest sister Cyndi, she passed away from an illness 4 years ago, who loved to ride. Maybe it‚Äôs because we get to ride on some of the less traveled backroads, see farm fields, the beautiful countryside, pass through smaller local towns, eat at local restaurants, the awesome wide open views all around me and most of all, did I say it already üòÑ I love being and riding with Chris and can‚Äôt wait to go on the next one. üòé.
