It is also a situation that feeds on the docility of the affrighted section of those who pose as Northern leaders today.</p><p>“The recent attacks have pushed matters to a point whereby silence has become complicity and inaction is no longer an option, making it impossible for us to remain indifferent or silent in the face of such extreme provocations.<br>As the representatives of various interest groups from Northern Nigeria, the CNG today declares enough is enough.</p><p>“The North will no longer remain passive under such deliberate and sustained attacks on its people and interests, and will henceforth be forced to react to every provocation and unwarranted violation.</p><p>“The North’s reticence in speaking out or taking action is not born of fear or ignorance of how to respond in kind and those who tempt us should know that the North is no longer going to turn the other cheek.</p><p>“We, therefore, invite the attention of southern leaders, their Northern collaborators and the bankrupt section of the Northern political elite and other authors of mindless violence and separatism who see it as their duty to actualise what their fathers started in 1966, to remember that people from other regions are residing and doing businesses all over the North and to warn them that we shall no longer be expected to turn the other cheek if Northerners would not be protected wherever they live as minorities in particularly Nigeria.</p><p>“We also warn media operators of an imminent boycott of patronage all over the North unless they change to being more restrained and balanced in their reporting of all situations in the country, particularly when matters coming from or affecting northerners are reported or commented on.</p><p>“We caution them to desist from and to eschew the slanted reporting of events with greater bias against a particular religious and ethnic group as is witnessed in the reporting of security situations recently.</p><p>“We warn that editorial policies and restraints imposed by ordinary decency and sanity must not be abandoned by the media establishment for sensational and often biased reporting that only inflame tensions in the country.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5FtZqenoqm1pr7NZp6rp6WlwG7CzrBkraddqrutscCsn2aslae%2FsL6MoqVmq5%2BqwamxwKyrZqemmr9utc2cnKyrkaPBbrfIpaOippeofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeremy-and-audrey-roloff-new-house.html><span>←</span><span>Jeremy and Audrey Roloff's New House Cost $1.5 Million</span></a>
