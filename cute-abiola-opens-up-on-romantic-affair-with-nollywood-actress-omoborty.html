Maybe because we just made content together. So, that content, the way we took pictures. I was holding her, holding her back, and her waist for the picture.</p><p>“The chat was not real. Her picture was not in the chat. The name was covered. For what? I did not know how that came up. That time, she felt so bad about it. I felt so bad too. Because I never wanted her to go through that stuff. And that time, she was so pained to the point that we stopped talking to each other. We have started talking now.</p><p>“The thing is that that never happened. I never dated her. We were just like she was my sister, and I was her brother. I even give her influencing jobs, saying, Ma, can you do this, someone wants to work with you. And the same as me. Nothing like that.</p><p>“When I saw it, I was surprised. The thing is that when the blog posted it, she said ‘what is this happening’? I was like, even me, I do not know.</p><p>“The more I talk, the more I put more fire.
