Finally, in the forward line, Antony comes into the starting line-up in favor of Garnacho.</p><p>As for Nottingham Forest, coach Steve Cooper made three changes from his side who also won in midweek against Blackburn.</p><p>Goalkeeper Dean Henderson was unable to play against his parent club meaning Hennessey started in goal for Forest. In defense, there were a further two changes with Lodi and Aurier replacing Toffolo and Williams at full-back.</p><p>From the start of the game, Manchester United looked more determined to push for a win. After just 19 minutes of football, the hosts grabbed the first goal thanks to Marcus Rashford”s strike.</p><p>Rashford took advantage of United’s second corner of the game to score Christian Eriksen’s assisted goal.</p><p>As Nottingham Forest thought they could fight back, United made the game more difficult for their visitors as Martial doubled United’s lead.</p><p>The goal was a beautiful teamwork as a lovely lofted ball from Fernandes set Rashford on his way up the left wing. He cut inside before feeding Martial on the edge of the box and his first-time shot squirms into the goal off the palm of Hennessey.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-615031 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tag_reuters.com2022_newsml_UP1EICR1LA85E_1927951467_768x432.jpg alt="Manchester United Beat Nottingham Forest To Keep Top Four Hope Alive " width=768 height=432 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-615031 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Anthony Martial doubled Manchester United’s lead against Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, December 27.</strong></p><p>In the 42nd minute, Forest almost got a goal back, unfortunately, the VAR disallowed the goal for offside.</p><p>After the first half which ended 2-0, the second half resumed in a bit caging way as the two sides failed to break each other defense.</p><p>United’s 2-0 lead lingered on until the 87th minute when Casemiro assisted his countryman, Fred to score United’s third goal of the match.</p><p>After 16 shots, 8 of which were on target, Manchester United ended the game with a deserved 3-0 win. The win left United in the 5th spot with 29 points in 15 games, a point below 4th-placed Tottenham.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze5FwZqaZnpi1pr%2FTnqlmrZ6ewaawjJucmqxdo7y1wMinnqGZnWKzsL7ErKtmrJ9iuKaxz2arqKhdm7y2voyhpqmdXZa5qsLEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-a-league-of-their-own-a-reboot.html><span>←</span><span>Is 'A League of Their Own' on Prime Video a Reboot?</span></a>
