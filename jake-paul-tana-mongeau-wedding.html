Jake and Tana announced their engagement on June 28 and exactly one month later, they are ready to walk down the aisle.&nbsp;</p><p>"Bet you didn’t think we’d be engaged for this long..." Tana captioned a series of engagement photos, after fans called out the YouTubers for faking their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it looks like the couple is actually getting married on July 28.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, where is Jake Paul and Tana Mongeau's wedding being held?&nbsp;</h2><p>According to a press release, Jake and Tana will be exchanging vows in Tana's hometown of Las Vegas. The couple's wedding will be held at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Graffiti Mansion</a>, which is owned by <a href=#>controversial Team 10 member Armani Izadi.</a>&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>The 6,000-square foot home promotes art and positive outlets for fans of all ages and is dedicated to the victims of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting.</p><p>Icons like Frank Sinatra, Elvis, and more recent figures like Floyd "Money" Mayweather and Conor McGregor were painted on the house in custom murals, which will be the backdrop for Tana and Jake's nuptials.&nbsp;</p><p>"In a ceremony sure to bring down the house and break the internet, the two are sealing the deal after a brief but passionate courtship of only two months," the press release reads. The same team behind Logan Paul and rapper Desiigner's birthday blowout will produce Jake and Tana's wedding ceremony.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What about Jake and Tana's wedding reception?</h2><p>After saying "I do," Jake and Tana will head to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sugar Factory American Brasserie</a> in Sin City, where there will be a red carpet for their influencer guests.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, that is the same Sugar Factory that the Kardashians made famous with their blinged-out lollipops.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who's on the wedding guest list?&nbsp;</h2><p>We expect Team 10 to come out and support their founder, Jake, and of course, his <a href=#>brother Logan Paul</a> is expected to be in attendance — even if he did just hint the wedding is a publicity stunt.</p><p>“I don’t know what’s going on there, man," he said of the relationship on Barstool Sports podcast, <a href=# rel=noopener title="(opens new window)">KFC Radio</a>. "There’s no exchange [of money], but you can make money together... Like, say you make merch together, you probably split like 50/50 split."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Fake or not, we don't expect <a href=#>Tana's ex Bella Thorne</a> to show up — after she started a Twitter feud with Tana shortly after her engagement was announced.&nbsp;</p><p>"Tana and I are no longer good," she wrote. "She broke girl code. I'm over it." After Tana accused the former Disney Channel star of airing their dirty laundry on social media, Bella responded, "U legit started dating me for Twitter.. how about u answer ur phone and talk to me instead of being on Twitter."&nbsp;</p><p>Yikes.&nbsp;</p><p>Congrats to the happy couple, we guess!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66ssYypmK6kXamur62Mpqann5WWwm7DxJ2boqaX</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hijab-crisis-unlike-makinde-and-fayemi-kwara-governor-encouraging-religious-crisis-can-warns.html><span>←</span><span>Hijab Crisis: Unlike Makinde And Fayemi, Kwara Governor Encouraging Religious Crisis</span></a>
