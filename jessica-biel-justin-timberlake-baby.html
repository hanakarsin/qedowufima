In early 2021, Justin finally confirmed that the rumors were true, and fans are over the moon for him, Jessica, and Silas.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake welcomed their first baby in 2015.</h2><p>Jessica and Justin's first baby — a son they named Silas Randall — was born on April 8, 2015. The protective parents have periodically shared photos of Silas since his birth, just without showing closeups or straight-on shots of his face. Although Jessica and Justin have prioritized their son's privacy, the parents have opened up about his delivery in recent years.</p><p>In 2018, Silas' parents described his birth in a book titled The Nanny Connie Way: Secrets to Mastering the First Four Months of Parenthood.</p><p>"We had two midwives, one doula, one meditation birthing class, a ton of hippie baby books, and a lovely home in the Hollywood Hills that we had turned into a labor training facility that we called The Octagon. So, not exactly normal," Jessica and Justin explained, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!

"I was obsessed with everything organic, toxin-free, natural, and homeopathic for our kid, who came into this world in an operating room through an incision.

Jessica's mother, Kimberly Conroe Biel, has reportedly been spending the past week with Jessica and her newest grand-baby.</p><p>Neither Justin nor Jessica immediately confirmed the baby news. But fans have noted in hindsight that the celebrity couple hadn't been publicly photographed since March in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, so it was entirely possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Jessica and Justin haven't shared any pictures of Jessica from the waist down via social media — aside from a shot of her wearing pajamas and a loose robe.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Celebrating my birthday in style... and by that I mean, in pajamas.

"He's awesome and so cute. Nobody's sleeping," Justin joked. "But we're thrilled. We're thrilled and couldn't be happier. Very grateful."
