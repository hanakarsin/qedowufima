They said they were happy with the manner he handled his defeat in 2015, conceding defeat even before the election results were fully announced without any form of bitterness and the cooperation he has been giving President Buhari. They also said as a true democrat, Nigeria needs him at this moment to unite the country.</p><p>“I am aware he (Jonathan) gave them only one condition. And that is if they are ready to make him the consensus presidential candidate of the party. He doesn’t want any acrimony that will arise from contesting the presidential primary at all. That is the only condition I am aware he gave to the APC leaders who are in talks with him”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5FxZmtoYmh6q7vNmquhmZ5itKrCxKxkqaqVqLalsc2csGabn6OxqsDIqKVmrJ9it7C1zWaYqZtdqLy2vsKeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./umahi-breaks-silence-on-disrupted-one-million-march-for-peter-obi-in-ebonyi.html><span>←</span><span>Umahi Breaks Silence On Disrupted 'One Million March' For Peter Obi In Ebonyi</span></a>
